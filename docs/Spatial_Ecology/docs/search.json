    "text": "The term Ecology was first coined by the naturalist Ernest Haeckel in 1866, defining it as the scientific study of the relationships between organisms and their environment. A more contemporary definition describes ecology as:\n“The scientific study of the distribution and abundance of organisms and the interactions that determine distribution and abundance” (Begon and Townsend 2021).\nStatistical ecology builds upon this foundation by integrating mathematical models with associated measures of probabilistic uncertainty to study ecological systems (Gilbert et al. 2024). Space is inherent to all ecological processes, influencing dynamics such as migration, dispersal, and species interactions. Spatial ecology aims to understand how these processes shape species distributions and dynamics across space. Its focus on the direct and indirect effects of space on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning has given rise to multiple subdisciplines within the life sciences, including landscape ecology, epidemiology, and animal movement, etc (Figure 1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Spatial subdisciplines derived from ecological disciplines using a spatial ecology framework (taken from (Fletcher and Fortin 2018).\n\n\n\nTo fully understand the relationship between space and ecological patterns and processes, the integration of statistical models is essential. These models not only help explain spatial dynamics but also provide the necessary framework to address key aspects of conservation. This includes mapping biodiversity and ecosystem services, providing insight into mitigating the impacts of environmental change, supporting effective prioritization of conservation areas, and establishing the foundation for developing tools and models that guide conservation effortssuch as the global goal for halting biodiversity loss proposed by the Nature Positive initiative (Figure 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: A measurable global goal for nature.

    "text": "Spatial scales\nScales describe the spatial and temporal dimensions at which an ecological process occurs. Many ecological patterns and processes occur at different spatial and temporal scales and thus, understanding and quantifying these scales is essential to provide an accurate intrepretation of the ecological processes we aimed to study.\nThe spatial scale is often described by the grain (a.k.a. spatial resolution) and the extent. The former refersto the finest spatial unit of measurement for a given process, whereas the later refer to the total length or area of the study. The ratio between these two measurements is knows as Scope.\nThere is typically a trade-off between the grain and the extent, mainly due to practicality. For example, it can be costly to work at large extents while collecting data at fine grain sizes. But also, some of the processes occurring at these finer scales become simply noise when we look at systems at larger extents.\nIn spatial ecology, the scale at which an ecological process occur can have a major impact on the interpretation of our analysis. For example, Figure 3 shows the locations of isopods burrows in the northern Negev Desert, Israel. If we look at the complete data set we can see a strong aggregation pattern. However, when focusing on two subsets with smaller extents, the observed patterns shift, ranging from random to aggregated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Isopod burrow data with n=2015 individual burrows in a study eare with an extent of 75 600 m\\(^2\\). Inset maps show two subsets with reduced extent of 6.4 m\\(^2\\) each. Source: (Dungan et al. 2002)\n\n\n\nThe spatial scale of analysis is crucial in ecological and environmental studies, as it can significantly influence the patterns we observe and the conclusions we draw. For example, changing the grain of the study (while holding the extent constant) can introduce bias and uncertainty in the observed ecological patterns. This is because aggregated data can have different properties than the sample data from which they were derived, i.e. the assumption that a relationships exists one level of aggregation does not necesarilly hold at another level of aggregation, particularly in situations where data are aggregated into irregular sampling units (modifiable areal unit problem -MAUP). This is illustrated in figure Figure 4, where two variables (v1 and v2) recorded on uniform point level show little correlation. As we aggregate the values on a larger grain size, we get a slight increase in the slope and \\(R^2\\) values. Now if we aggregate the same point data using the non-homogeneous aggregation scheme now v1 and v2 become highly correlated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Plots of variables v1 and v2 for each individual in the survey and summarized using a uniform and non-uniform aggregation scheme\n\n\n\nThus, if we the data we had at hand came from the non-uniform aggregation scheme, it would be wrong to assume that a correlation also exists on an individual-level data. In ecology this is knows as ecological fallacy, which arises when incorrect inferences about individual sample units are made based on aggregated data.\nFor example, aggregating species abundance (counts) data at a national scale might obscure local hotspots of biodiversity observed at finer scales. Results depend on how the areas are divided, even if the total number of zones remains constant. Different arrangements of the same spatial units can lead to different conclusions. When individual-level data is grouped, the variability within units is lost, which can mask finer-scale patterns or exaggerate certain trends.As consequence, conservation strategies should consider the spatial scale for effective conservation decisions."
