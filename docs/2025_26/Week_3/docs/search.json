    "text": "In this section we recap some important statistical properties of our estimators (for further details please refer to the statistical inference course).\nA population parameter \\(\\theta\\) represents a quantitative measurement of population values. Since \\(\\theta\\) is typically unknown, we need to estimate it by drawing samples from the population of interest. Our estimator, \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\),is then computed based on the samples we have obtained. The question is then, how well does \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) do its job in estimating \\(\\theta\\)? To evaluate this, we examine key statistical properties of estimators.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Sampling from Normal Distribution. The black curve represent the true population distribution with mean represented by the black solid line. The colored point are two different samples with their corresponding sample mean shown in colured dashed lines.\n\n\n\n\nConsistency\nAs we see in Figure 1, there is some discrepancy between the sample means and the true population mean. Thus, it is expected that, as the sample size increases, our estimator \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) will get closer to the true value \\(\\theta\\). Thus an estimator \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) is said to be consistent if it converges to the true parameter \\(\\theta\\) as the sample size \\(n\\) increases, i.e., \\(\\hat{\\theta} \\rightarrow \\theta\\) as \\(n\\to\\infty\\). E.g., let \\(\\hat{\\theta} = \\bar{x} + \\frac{1}{n}\\) be a biased but consistent estimator of \\(\\theta = 5\\) (\\(\\bar{x}\\) represents the sample mean). Figure 2 shows how as sample size increases, the estimator converges to the true parameter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Demonstration of estimator consistency. The dashed red line indicates the true parameter value. The blue line tracks the mean estimate across increasing sample sizes, while the shaded region represents the 95% confidence interval.\n\n\n\n\nExpected value\nThe expected value of an estimator is a weighted average of all possible estimates. Here, the weights are given by the probability of selecting a particular sample \\(s\\), i.e., \\(p(s)\\). Mathematically, this can be written as:\n\\[\n\\mathbb{E}(\\hat{\\theta})= \\sum_{x\\in\\Omega} p(s)\\hat{\\theta(s)}\n\\]\nWhere \\(\\Omega\\) is the sample space, i.e. the number of possible samples. Furthermore, if all possible samples are equally likely then \\(p(s)=\\frac{1}{\\Omega}\\) and the expected values becomes:\n\\[\n\\mathbb{E}(\\hat{\\theta}) = \\dfrac{1}{\\Omega} \\sum_{s\\in\\Omega} \\hat{\\theta}(s).\n\\]\nNote that the expected value is a function of both, the sampling design (due to \\(p(s)\\)) and the population being sampled (through the sample estimate \\(\\hat{\\theta}(s)\\)).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Task 1\n\n\n\nSuppose we have a tiny population of three trees with the following diameters (cm) :\n\n\nTree\ndiameter (cm)\n\n\n\n1\n9.1\n\n\n2\n10.2\n\n\n3\n17.2\n\n\n\nNow, we sample only 2 trees and measure the diameter of each tree in the sample. It is clear from here that there are only \\(\\Omega=3\\) possible samples we could’ve taken:\n\n\\(s_1 = \\{\\text{tree 1},\\text{tree 2}\\}\\)\n\\(s_2 = \\{\\text{tree 1},\\text{tree 3}\\}\\)\n\\(s_3 = \\{\\text{tree 2},\\text{tree 3}\\}\\)\n\nImagine that samples are selected with an equal probability so that \\(p(s_1) = p(s_2) = p(s_3) = 1/3\\).\nThe true population mean diameter is \\(\\mu_y = ( 9.1+10.2+ 17.2)/3 =12.17\\).\nSuppose we chose the sample average \\(\\bar{y}\\) as our estimate of \\(\\mu_y\\). Then, the expected value of \\(\\bar{y}\\) is given by\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\\mathbb{E}(\\bar{y}) &= p(s_1) \\left(\\dfrac{9.1+10.2}{2}\\right) +  p(s_2) \\left(\\dfrac{9.1+17.2}{2}\\right) +  p(s_3) \\left(\\dfrac{10.2+17.2}{2}\\right)\\\\&= \\dfrac{1}{3}\\left(\\dfrac{19.3}{2} + \\dfrac{26.3}{2} + \\dfrac{27.4}{2} \\right)\\\\&= 12.17 = \\mu_y\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nWhat would have happened if our sampling design had unequal sampling probabilities given by \\(p(s_1) = 1/2\\), \\(p(s_2) = 1/3\\) and \\(p(s_3) = 1/6\\)? Calculate \\(\\mathbb{E}(\\hat{y})\\) under this sampling scenario.\n\n\nSee Solution\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbb{E}(\\bar{y}) &= p(s_1) \\left(\\dfrac{9.1+10.2}{2}\\right) +  p(s_2) \\left(\\dfrac{9.1+17.2}{2}\\right) +  p(s_3) \\left(\\dfrac{10.2+17.2}{2}\\right)\\\\\n&= \\dfrac{1}{2}\\left(\\dfrac{19.3}{2} \\right) + \\frac{1}{3} \\left(\\dfrac{26.3}{2}\\right) + \\dfrac{1}{6}\\left(\\dfrac{27.4}{2} \\right)\\\\\n&= \\dfrac{19.3}{4}  + \\dfrac{26.3}{6} + \\dfrac{27.4}{12} \\\\\n&= 11.5 \\neq \\mu_y\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\n\nIn practice, \\(\\mathbb{E}(\\hat{\\theta})\\) cannot be evaluated because we can not measure all the \\(N\\) elements of our population of interest! (and if we could then \\(\\theta\\) could be evaluated directly on our population rather than obtaining a samples from it). However, understanding this concept is important for two other relevant quantities.\nBias\nThe bias of an estimator is the difference in magnitude between its expected value and the population parameter for which an estimated is desired:\n\\[\n\\textbf{Bias}(\\hat{\\theta}) = \\mathbb{E}(\\hat{\\theta}) - \\theta\n\\]\nWhen \\(\\mathbb{E}(\\hat{\\theta}) = \\theta\\) , \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) is said to be an unbiased estimator of \\(\\theta\\).\nNote that the bias is not a property of an individual estimate (e.g., \\(\\hat{\\theta}(s)\\)). E.g., we can see in Figure 1 there are some discrepancies between the true population parameter \\(\\theta\\) and the sample estimates \\(\\hat{\\theta}(1)\\) and \\(\\hat{\\theta}(2)\\). Such discrepancies \\(\\hat{\\theta}(s) - \\theta\\) are known as sampling errors. This doesn’t mean that an error has been made during the sampling, it just indicates that the value being estimated will differ from the true value because is being estimated from just a fraction of the elements of the population. Thus, one may wonder how much an estimate \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) from one sample will differ from that calculated from a different sample. In principle we would like this difference to be small because that will ensure that no matter which sample we take, the estimated value will be similar across samples.\nVariance\nThe variance of an estimator or sampling variance is the average squared distance between individual estimates \\(\\hat{\\theta}(s)\\) and their expected value \\(\\mathbb{E}(\\hat{\\theta})\\), i.e.,\n\\[\n\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\theta}) = \\sum_{s\\in \\Omega} p(s) \\left(\\hat{\\theta}(s)-\\mathbb{E}(\\hat{\\theta})\\right)^2\n\\] Notice how the variance of an estimator does not depend (unlike the bias) on the true parameter \\(\\theta\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Task 2\n\n\n\nUsing the data from the previous task and assuming equal sampling probabilities, calculate \\(\\text{Var}(\\hat{y})\\)\n\n\nSee Solution\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{Var}(\\bar{y}) &= p(s_1) \\left(\\dfrac{19.3}{2} - 12.17\\right)^2 +  p(s_2) \\left(\\dfrac{26.3}{2} - 12.17\\right)^2 +  p(s_3) \\left(\\dfrac{27.4}{2} - 12.17\\right)^2\\\\\n&= \\dfrac{1}{3}\\left(  9.65 \\right) =  3.22\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\n\nPrecision\nThe precision of an estimator is a qualitative measurement that assess how small or large the variability of an estimator is and does not relate to the true value. To illustrate this, suppose we draw 20 random samples with equal probability from our population of interest . Figure 3 shows 100 replicates/data sets of this experiment with 4 different estimators:\n\n\\(\\hat{\\theta}_{1}(s) =\\frac{1}{20}\\sum_{i=1}^{20} x_i\\) - the mean of the \\(s\\)th sample which is unbiased and precise\n\\(\\hat{\\theta}_{2}(s) = \\text{arg min } (x_1,\\ldots, x_{20})\\) - the \\(s\\)th sample minimum value which is biased and imprecise.\n\\(\\hat{\\theta}_{3}(s)  = x_1\\) - the first observation of the unordered sample which is unbiased and imprecise.\n\\(\\hat{\\theta}_{4}(s) =2 + \\frac{1}{20}\\sum_{i=1}^{20} x_i\\) - the mean + constant which is biased but precise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Illustration of bias and precision of an estimator. The red dashed line shows the true population parameter. the grey point shows the sample of the j-th data set, and the colored points indicate the estimates for each sample.\n\n\nImagine a dartboard where the bullseye represents the true population parameter (\\(\\theta\\)). Each throw corresponds to a sample estimate (\\(\\hat{\\theta}(s)\\)). Precision refers to how tightly clustered the darts are - a precise estimator produces estimates that land close together, regardless of their position relative to the bullseye. Bias, on the other hand, is the systematic offset from the bullseye - even with perfect precision, a biased estimator would consistently miss the center in the same direction."

Be aware of practical challenges that might impact the subsequent analysis such as: accessibility contains to the selected sampling site, landowner permission, safety issues, unfavorable environmental conditions, etc.\n\nOften statisticians will not actually carry out the sampling, but will instead rely on field experts in many cases. Once we receive the data, it’s important to assess the data for censoring, outliers, missingness. We can then fit an appropriate statistical model. Finally, we should report our results in clear language, including uncertainty where appropriate.\nIn this session we will look at different sampling schemes commonly used in environmental and ecological monitoring. A sampling strategy integrates both sample selection methods from a target population and estimation techniques to infer population attributes from sample measurements.\nSuch attributes can be viewed as a quantitative combination of population values such as the mean Orthophosphate \\([\\text{PO}_4]^{3-}\\) concentration or the total number of macroinvertebrates in a river. Likewise, an estimator is a mathematical expression or a function of the sample that provide us with a estimate of the population parameter. For instance, let \\(\\theta\\) denote the population parameter of interest (e.g., the population mean), then \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) represents its estimator (see [additional notes]{about.qmd} on estimator properties). Typically, the value of \\(\\theta\\) is unknown and it is unfeasible to measure all \\(N\\) elements of the population. Thus, we select and measure \\(n &lt; N\\) units to estimate \\(\\theta\\).

    "section": "3.4 Spatial Sampling",
    "text": "3.4 Spatial Sampling\nSpatial sampling is required when our data have an attribute that is spatially continuous. For example, if we are measuring water quality in a lake, we may have a three-dimensional coordinate system of length, width and depth. In some cases, it is possible to measure at any one of these locations, and simple random sampling or stratified sampling can be used. There are many examples where it is not possible or convenient to do so, in which case some form of systematic sampling may be used.\nSpatial sampling often uses a systematic sampling scheme based on transects. A transect is a straight line along which samples are taken. The starting point, geographical orientation and number of samples are chosen as part of the sampling scheme. Samples will then be either taken at random points along the length of the line (continuous sampling) or systematically placed points (systematic sampling).\nSuppose we need to take samples of water quality on a lake. Our sampling scheme may use multiple transects simultaneously.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4.1 Distance sampling\nIn ecology, distance sampling, is a widely used spatial sampling method for estimating animal abundance or population density by measuring the perpendicular distances from a transect line or point to detected individuals Figure 1 . The methods assumes that the probability of observing animals decreases with increasing distance from the observer according to a specific detection function. The distance data are modelled using this detection function to account for imperfect detection and estimate the proportion of missed individuals in the study area.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Illustration of a distance sampling scheme. On the left, the true species distribution point pattern, the vertical transects (dashed lines) and detected individuals along each transect (blue points). On the right hand side, the distribution of the observed distances from each transect to each detected individual.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4.2 Quadrats\nIn some cases, we will instead be interested in trying to understand the frequency of a certain species across space. A quadrat is a tool used in ecology and other settings for this purpose. A series of squares (quadrats) of a fixed size are placed in the habitat of interest, and the species within the quadrats are counted. The number of quadrats, and their positions and orientations are chosen as part of the sampling scheme.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4.3 Grid Sampling\nIt may often be useful to use a regular grid to make sampling convenient and efficient. The grid is overlaid on the spatial region, and a fixed number of samples (usually one) is taken from each grids square. We choose the size of the grid such that the number of squares relates to the number of samples we require. For example, for a region of size 5km \\(\\times\\) 5km, choosing 1km \\(\\times\\) 1km grid squares would give us 25 squares in total.\nThere are a few different types of grid sampling.\n\nAligned Grid — we take a sample from the same (randomly selected) coordinates within each square.\nCentrally Aligned Grid — we take a sample from the central coordinates of each square.\nUnaligned Grid — each grid square has a sample taken from different randomly selected coordinates.\nTriangular Grid — this is a modified version of the aligned grid where the points are fixed based on a triangular arrangement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe aligned and centrally aligned grids are convenient but may miss systematic patterns in the data. The unaligned grid avoids this, and combines the advantages of simple random sampling and stratified sampling. However, it can be inefficient for collection. The triangular grid can perform well in specific cases where the spatial correlation structures varies with direction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Exercise 1: Heights of trees\n\n\n\nAim: Estimate the average height of trees which are uniformly distributed within a 10 km\\(^2\\) forest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the population here?\n\n\n\nSolution\n\nThe population is all trees in the forest.\n\n\nWhat are the sampling units?\n\n\n\nSolution\n\nOur sampling units are individual trees.\n\n\nWhat type of sampling scheme would be appropriate here?\n\n\n\nSolution\n\nSimple random sampling would likely be appropriate here, since it allows us to cover the large area of the forest at low “cost” (time and financial). The trees are uniformly distributed across the forest, so no need for strata. You could argue for systematic sampling using a grid or quadrats, but this may make analysis more complex.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Exercise 2: Chlorophyll-a in Lake Balaton\n\n\n\nAim: Estimate the average level of chlorophyll-a on Lake Balaton, Hungary. Levels are heavily affected by differences in the levels of nutrients along the length of the lake (known as a ‘trophic gradient’).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the population here?\n\n\n\nSolution\n\nThe population is all possible water samples from the lake.\n\n\nWhat are the sampling units?\n\n\n\nSolution\n\nOur sampling units are individual water samples.\n\n\nWhat type of sampling scheme would be appropriate here?\n\n\n\nSolution\n\nStratified random sampling seems appropriate here due to heterogeneity in the lake. We could design transects which cover most regions of the lake. However, may be difficulty accessing all areas by boat. Also, there are potential issues with the boat itself disrupting the levels."

As well as considering the sample size, we also have to think about how to allocate our samples across the strata. A common approach is to specify a cost model, where we take into account the different costs of sampling each stratum. The aim is to minimize the estimated standard error for a given total cost.\nLet \\(C\\) be the overall cost, let \\(c_0\\) be the fixed overhead costs of the survey and let \\(c_l\\) be the cost per sample in stratum \\(l\\). Then our cost model is \\[C = c_0 + \\sum_{l=1}^L c_l n_l\\]\nTypically \\(C\\) is fixed, and the goal is to select the values of \\(n_l\\) which allow us to obtain the best possible estimate.\nNow let \\(\\omega_l = N_l/N\\) be the proportion of the overall population which is found within stratum \\(l\\). Also let \\(\\sigma_l\\) be the standard deviation for the population of stratum \\(l\\).\nWe can then compute the optimum number of samples in each stratum as \\[n_l = n\\frac{\\omega_l \\sigma_l /\\sqrt{c_l}}{\\sum_{k=1}^L \\omega_k \\sigma_k  /\\sqrt{c_k}}\\]\nIf the costs are the same for all strata, the equation simplifies to what is known as the Neyman allocation \\[n_l = n\\frac{\\omega_l \\sigma_l}{\\sum_{k=1}^L \\omega_k \\sigma_k}\\]\nWe often calculate \\(n\\) by a similar approach as that described for simple random sampling. In practice, the population standard deviation \\(\\sigma_l\\) is often replaced by the sample standard deviation, \\(s_l\\).\nWe now know how to determine the correct sample size to use to obtain estimates with the desired precision. This requires some advance knowledge, e.g. the tolerable level of error, the cost of the experiment, or the expected standard deviation. However, bear in mind that we have not considered the possibility of missing data in our sample, and losing some data will impact precision. We have also assumed all data points are independent, but this is not always true for time series or spatial data. (We will address this later in the course.)"

    "text": "5.1 Generalised Randomised Tessellation Stratified\nThe Generalised Randomised Tessellation Stratified (GRTS) is a form of spatially balanced probability sampling scheme introduced by Stevens and Olsen (2004). It has been widely used for monitoring extensive environmental resources by USEPA and Marine Scotland. It builds on random, systematic and stratified sampling procedures while ensuring spatial balance (where every replicate of the sample exhibits a spatial density pattern that resembles the spatial density pattern of the resource of interest). The GRTS algorithm can be implemented as follows:\n\nFirst one must determine the inclusion probability of each site/feature (e.g., trees, river breaches, lakes, etc.). For example, there are \\(N= 16\\) main lakes in the lake district and a sample of \\(n=4\\) is desired. Assuming equal sampling probabilities the inclusion probabilities are \\(n/N = 4/16 = 0.25\\) for each lake.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA square bounding box is superimposed onto the sampling frame and is divided into four equally sized square cells (level 1 cells). Each cell is then randomly labelled/numbered, e.g.,\\(\\mathcal{A}_1\\equiv \\{a_1:a_1 - 0,1,2,3\\}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach square is split into four more tessellations which are again randomly numbered while retaining the first-level label. The set of level-two cells is denoted by \\(\\mathcal{A}_2 \\equiv \\{a_1a_2 : a_1 = 0,1,2,3; ~a_2 = 0,1,2,3\\}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContinue this hierarchical randomisation to the desired spatial scale such that \\(\\mathcal{A}_k \\equiv \\{a_1,\\ldots,a_k:a_1 = 0,1,2,3; \\ldots; a_k = 0,1,2,3\\}\\) until the sum of the inclusion probabilities of each element within a given square are less than one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe elements (e.g., lakes) in \\(\\mathcal{A}_k\\) are placed in hierachichal order by sorting out \\(\\mathcal{A}_k\\) by the level 1 cells from smallest to largest, then by the level-two cells from smallest to largest, and so on. This will transform the level \\(k\\) grid cell to a one-dimensional number line. The length of each line-segment represents the inclusion probability for a given site (or lake in this example). Thus, the line’s total length equals the sum of these inclusion probabilities (the sum should equal \\(n\\) since we do not allow the inclusion value within a cell to be greater than one). Here we have colored cells contianing larger lakes in red and small lakes in blue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, we can use systematic sampling along the line to select the lakes to survey. E.g., you can randomly draw \\(u_1\\) from an uniform [0,1] and place it on a line. Imagine we draw \\(u_1 = 0.53\\), then location of \\(u_1\\) on the line falls within some line segment that represents a site, which we denote \\(s_1\\) (in the example this is the lake in cell 010). We include this sites as our first site in the sample and then continue with the next \\(j\\) sites by setting \\(u_j = u_{j-1} +1\\) for \\(j = 2,\\ldots,n\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuppose we would like larger lakes to be twice as likely to be selected as small lakes. Thus, instead of given all lakes the same unit length we can give large lakes twice the unit length of small lakes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to unequal inclusion probabilities we can also perform stratified sampling. Thus, instead of sampling from the entire sampling frame simultaneously, we divide a sampling frame into distinct sets of sites and select samples from each stratum independently of other strata -we apply the GRTS algorithm to obtain stratum-specific sample sizes. The R-package spsurvey implements GRTS algorithm to select spatially balanced samples via the grts() function."

    "section": "5.2 Before-after-Impact approaches",
    "text": "5.2 Before-after-Impact approaches\nThe purpose of monitoring is to assess the changes in a particular variable over time. This can typically be carried out using standard statistical techniques, taking into account the structure of the data. Sometimes we are interested in whether a specific event has had an impact on the variable, e.g., the effect of new regulations on the air pollution level. Typically this involves assessing the levels before and after the event.\nIt is generally very difficult to untangle the effects of a single event. Even if we identify a change in the mean or variance, how do we know that it is due to our event? Many environmental systems change naturally over time for any number of reasons. We do not have a statistical control, meaning that we can’t turn back the clock and check what would have happened without the event.\nHowever, this challenge is not unique to environmental data. We face it regularly in statistics. Often, we are only interested in the effect of one particular variable, but we have to account for other nuisance variables via regression or other techniques. We can also sometimes account for other unmeasured variability through random effects. The key is to acknowledge what you do and don’t know, and to account properly for uncertainty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Examples: Before-After Designs\n\n\n\n\nBefore-After Single Site\n\nOften, we wish to assess the impact of an intervention on a site, but we only have data for that site.\n\n\n\nLine graph of value by time, illustrating the impact of an intervention. The blue arrows represent the time “before” the intervation and the red arrows represent the time “after” the intervantion.\n\n\nWe can fit a statistical model, such as: \\[X_{ik} = \\mu + \\alpha_i + \\tau_{k(i)} + \\varepsilon_{ik}\\] with \\(\\mu\\) representing the overall mean, \\(\\alpha_i\\) the effect of period (before/after), \\(\\tau_{k(i)}\\) the time within period, and \\(\\varepsilon_{ik}\\) the errors.\nThis is not an ideal design, since we have no control to compare to.\n\nBefore-After Multiple Sites\n\nWe can sometimes improve upon the Before-After Single Site design, if we can collect data at multiple \\(j=1,\\ldots,M\\) sites that are likely to be impacted by the intervention. We can fit a statistical model, such as:\n\\[\nX_{ijk} = \\mu + \\alpha_i + \\tau_{jk(i)} + \\delta_j + \\varepsilon_{ijk},\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\mu\\) is the overall mean; \\(\\alpha_i\\) is the effect of period (before/after); \\(\\tau_{jk(i)}\\) represents the time within the ith period; \\(\\delta_j\\) is the site \\(j\\) random effect and \\(\\varepsilon_{ijk}\\) are the sampling errors.\n\n\n\nLine graph of value by time, illustrating the impact of an intervention. Each line connects the data points for a single site.\n\n\nTreating the sites as subsamples allows the sites to be used to improve estimation of the effect’s magnitude, compared to a single site design.\n\nBefore-After Control-Impact (BACI)\n\nBACI is a common design, where one or more potentially impacted sites, and one or more sites that are thought not vulnerable to impact, are sampled before and after the time of the intervention.\n\n\n\nLine graph of value by time, illustrating the impact of an intervention on the “impact” site. The two lines connect the data points for two sites (one impact site and one control site).\n\n\nWe can fit a statistical model, such as: \\[X_{ij} = \\mu + \\alpha_i + \\beta_j + (\\alpha\\beta)_{ij} + \\varepsilon_{ij}\\] with \\(\\mu\\) representing the overall mean, \\(\\alpha_i\\) the effect of period (before/after), \\(\\beta_j\\) the effect of location (control/impact), and \\(\\varepsilon_{ik}\\) the errors.\nHaving the control sites allows us to better assess whether any impacts are caused by the intervention."
