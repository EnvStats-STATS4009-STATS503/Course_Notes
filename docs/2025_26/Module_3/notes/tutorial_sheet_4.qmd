# Areal processes


The figure below shows coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) across a lake along with the corresponding Moran\'s I plot (@fig-moransi). 

![Lake CDOM plotted over space (left) and the corresponding Moran\'s I plot (right) based on Queen\'s distance](images/moransI_tutorial.png){#fig-moransi fig-align="center"}

The estimated Global Moran\'s I is 0.02 with a variance of 0.02.

::: callout-note
## Interpreting Moran's I plot

A **Moran\'s I scatter plot** visualizes spatial autocorrelation by plotting the values of observations in different areas against their **spatially lagged values**, which represent the weighted average of neighboring values. A positive correlation in the plot suggests **spatial clustering** (similar values are located near each other), while a negative correlation indicates **spatial dispersion** (neighboring values tend to be dissimilar). The slope of the regression line through the points provides an estimate of **Moran\'s I**, a statistic that quantifies the degree of spatial autocorrelation.

## Task 1 {.unnumbered}


Define what is meant by the term neighbourhood matrix and discuss two approaches for defining it, giving a drawback of each

## Task 2 {.unnumbered} 

Comment on the spatial variability in CDOM for this lake, with specific reference to the Moran\'s I plot


## Task 3 {.unnumbered} 

 In your own words what does the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP) refers to?
 
 
## Task 4 {.unnumbered} 
 
@fig-Penn shows the number of lung cancer cases in Pennsylvania per county, USA, in 2002.

data("pennLC_sf")

ggplot()+geom_sf(data= pennLC_sf,aes(fill=cases)) + scale_fill_continuous(low="white", high="navy")+

       subtitle = "Pennsylvania (2002)",
       fill = "Num. of Cases")+
  theme_minimal()

```

1. Interpret the map , what does this tells you about the number of lung cancer cases?

2. In addition to the number of cases, the data set contains county-level information of the following variables:

- Expected number of cases $E_i$ computed as $E_i = \sum_{j=1}^{m} r_j \times n_j$ ( $r_j$ is rate of disease and $n_j$ the population  in stratum $j$)
- Overall county smoking rate

Propose a reasonable spatially explicit model to assess the relationship between lung cancer risk and smoking.




#  Geostatistics

## Task 5 {.unnumbered}

 Suppose we have a geostatistical process, $\{Z(s); s \in D\},~ D \subset\mathbb{R}^2$ which is stationary with mean, $\mu_z$ and covariance $\mathrm{Cov}(h)$. Define what is meant by:

   -   weakly stationary
   -   isotropic

Then, write  down  an  expression  for  the  autocorrelation  function $\rho_z(h)$  in  terms  of  the covariance function.


## Task 6 {.unnumbered}

 @fig-Q5_a below shows summary plots for measurements of a geostatistical process, namely levels of Nitrogen measured at different locations across Chesapeake Bay, USA. Subjectively, comment on what each of these plots tells you about the data

![Summary plots for nitrogen levels across Chesapeake bay. Top left plot colour scale red to blue (high to low values).](images/tutorial3_geostats.png){#fig-Q5_a fig-align="center" width="450"}

## Task 7 {.unnumbered} 

Describe how you would check for spatial correlation in the data and model it if it were present.


## Task 8 {.unnumbered}

An empirical semi-variogram with a MC envelope is shown below (@fig-Q5c). Comment on the plot with regards to the presence of spatial correlation.

# Point Processes

## Task 9  {.unnumbered}

Explain what a spatial point pattern is, define complete spatial randomness, and how it is assessed.

## Task 10  {.unnumbered}
Discuss two limitations of using Ripleys' $K$ for assessing CSR in spatial point patterns.


## Task 11 {.unnumbered}
@fig-ripleysK (a, left) shows the $K$ function for the locations of 500 trees of a particular species within an area of tropical rainforest while @fig-ripleysK (b, right) shows the $K$ function for the Lansing wood tree species. For each of these plots comment on the spatial pattern of the data that generated the K functions with respect to complete spatial randomness.
