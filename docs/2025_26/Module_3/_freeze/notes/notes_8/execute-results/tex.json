In these data we regularly take measurements of a spatially continuous ecological or process at a set of fixed locations. This could be data from transects (e.g, where the height of trees is recorded), samples taken across a region (e.g., water depth in a lake) or from monitoring stations as part of a network (e.g., air pollution). In each of these cases, our goal is to estimate the value of our variable across the entire space.\n\nLet $D$ be our two-dimensional region of interest. In principle, there are infinite locations within $D$, each of which can be represented by mathematical coordinates (e.g., latitude and longitude). We then can identify any individual location as $s_i = (x_i, y_i)$, where $x_i$ and $y_i$ are their coordinates.\n\nWe can treat our variable of interest as a random variable, $Z$ which can be observed at any location as $Z(\\mathbf{s}_i)$.\n\nOur geostatistical process can therefore be written as: $$\\{Z(\\mathbf{s}); \\mathbf{s} \\in D\\}$$\n\nIn practice, our data are observed at a finite number of locations, $m$, and can be denoted as:\n\n$$z = \\{z(\\mathbf{s}_1), \\ldots z(\\mathbf{s}_m) \\}$$\n\nWe have observed our data at $m$ locations, but often want to predict this process at a set of unknown locations. For example, what is the value of $z(\\mathbf{s}_0)$, where $\\mathbf{s}_0$ is an unobserved site?\n\nThere are two main steps in classical geostatistical analysis.\n\nHow do I produce a statistical model for the data?\n\nHow do I use my model to estimate quantities of interest?\n\nThe first part requires us to think about how our measured data points relate to each other - in other words, to understand spatial autocorrelation. The second part requires us to use that information to predict the value at unmeasured locations, and then to produce maps or summary statistics based on this.\n\n# Spatial autocorrelation\n\nSpatial statistics and geostatistics quantify spatial variance and correlation based on distance, aligning with Tobler's law---nearby measurements tend to be more correlated, while this relationship weakens with distance. Spatial dependence can reveal ecological processes like species interactions and responses to environmental gradients. However, it also poses challenges for statistical analysis, as it violates the common assumption of independent data in traditional methods.\n\nAnalyzing spatial dependence can offer insights into the biological processes shaping observed patterns, such as social behavior, resource distribution, or dispersal. While measuring spatial dependence alone may not provide definitive answers, it helps generate hypotheses and refine predictions. Additionally, spatial dependence can influence assessments of conservation threats and strategies.\n\nSpatial correlation is usually driven by some unmeasured confounding variable(s) - for example, air pollution is spatially correlated because nearby areas tend to experience similar traffic levels.\n\nIt is important that we account for these correlations in our analysis - failing to do so will lead to poor inference. For a set of geostatistical data $\\mathbf{z} = \\{ z(\\mathbf{s}_1), \\ldots, z(\\mathbf{s}_m) \\}$, we can consider the general model: $$Z(\\mathbf{s}_i) = \\mu(\\mathbf{s}_i) + e(\\mathbf{s}_i)$$\n\nHere $\\mu(\\mathbf{s}_i)$ is a mean function which models trend and covariate effects. Then $e(\\mathbf{s}_i)$ is the error process which accounts for any spatial correlation which exists after accounting for $\\mu(\\mathbf{s}_i)$. Spatial statistics is therefore often focused on understanding the process for $e(\\mathbf{s}_i)$.\n\nWe have observations at $m$ locations $$\\mathbf{z} = \\{ z(\\mathbf{s}_1), \\ldots, z(\\mathbf{s}_m) \\}.$$\n\nWe want to use these to obtain an estimate of $Z(\\mathbf{s}_0)$ where $\\mathbf{s}_0$ is an unobserved location. How do we model the spatial dependence between our observed sites $\\mathbf{s}_1, \\ldots, \\mathbf{s}_m$? What does this tell us about the dependence between our observed sites and our unobserved site $\\mathbf{s}_0$?\n\n## Variograms\n\nThe first step is to assess whether there is any evidence of spatial dependency in our data.\n\nThe function describing the dependence between values of our process $Z$ separated by different lags is known as the **autocovariance function**. This is similar to the autocorrelation function (ACF) used for temporal data.\n\nIn geostatistical models, we can summarise the covariance structure of a spatial Gaussian random field with its **variogram** $2\\gamma(\\cdot)$ (or semivariogram $\\gamma(\\cdot)$). The variogram measures the variance of the difference in the process at two spatial locations $\\mathbf{s}$ and $\\mathbf{s+h}$ and is defined as (under weakly stationary): $$\\mathrm{Var}[Z(\\mathbf{s}) - Z(\\mathbf{s} + \\mathbf{h})] = E[(Z(\\mathbf{s}) - Z(\\mathbf{s} + \\mathbf{h}))^2] = 2\\gamma_z(\\mathbf{h}).$$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathrm{Var}[Z(\\mathbf{s}) - Z(\\mathbf{s} + \\mathbf{h})]& =  E[Z(\\mathbf{s}) - Z(\\mathbf{s} + \\mathbf{h})^2] - \\{E[Z(\\mathbf{s}) - Z(\\mathbf{s} + \\mathbf{h})]\\}^2\\\\\n&= E[Z(\\mathbf{s}) - Z(\\mathbf{s} + \\mathbf{h})^2] - \\{E[Z(\\mathbf{s})] - E[ Z(\\mathbf{s} + \\mathbf{h})]\\}^2\\\\\n&= E[Z(\\mathbf{s}) - Z(\\mathbf{s} + \\mathbf{h})^2] - \\{\\mu-\\mu\\}^2 =  E[Z(\\mathbf{s}) - Z(\\mathbf{s} + \\mathbf{h})^2] \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nHere, $2\\gamma_z(\\mathbf{h})$ is the variogram, but in practice we use the **semi-variogram**, $\\gamma_z(\\mathbf{h})$. We use the semi-variogram because our points come in pairs, and the semi-variance is equivalent to the variance per point at a given lag.\n\n-   When the variance of the difference $Z(\\mathbf{s}) - Z(\\mathbf{t})$ is relatively small, then $Z(\\mathbf{s})$ and $Z(\\mathbf{t})$ are similar (spatially correlated).\n\n-   When the variance of the difference $Z(\\mathbf{s}) - Z(\\mathbf{t})$ is relatively large, then $Z(\\mathbf{s})$ and $Z(\\mathbf{t})$ are less similar (closer to independence).\n\nThe variogram is a function of the underlying geostatistical process $Z$. In practice, we only have access to $m$ realisations of this process, and therefore we have to estimate the variogram. This is known as the *empirical variogram*.\n\nWe obtain this by computing the semi-variance for all possible pairs of observations: $\\gamma(\\mathbf{s}, \\mathbf{t}) = 0.5(Z(\\mathbf{s}) - Z(\\mathbf{t}))^2$.\n\n### Example: Constructing a Variogram\n\nThe data `parana` from the `geoR` Package contains the average rainfall over different years for the period May to June at 123 monitoring stations in Paraná state, Brazil.\n\nOur goal is to model the asses if there is spatial correlation in the data so that we can predict rainfall levels at unsampled locations. Our data consist of location coordinates and rainfall levels.\n\n::: panel-tabset\n# Exploratory plots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Rainfall values measured at 143 recording stations in Paraná state, Brazil withlow values being represented in blue and high values in red.](notes_8_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-2-1.pdf){fig-align='center'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# R Code\n\nWe can use `ggplot` to map the rainfall levels as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(geoR)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(gstat)\n\ndata.frame(cbind(parana$coords, Rainfall = parana$data)) %>%\nggplot()+\n  geom_point(aes(east, north, color = Rainfall), size = 2) +\n  coord_fixed(ratio = 1) +\n  scale_color_gradient(low = \"blue\", high = \"orange\") +\n  geom_path(data = data.frame(parana$border), aes(east, north)) +\n  theme_bw()\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n:::\n\nTo illustrate how an empirical variogram is computed, consider the two highlighted locations below.\n\n![](images/parana_ex1.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"586\"}\n\n1.  We can first compute the distance between the two locations using the Euclidean distance formula $$h = \\sqrt{(475.1 - 403)^2 + (83.6 - 164.5)^2} = 108.36$$\n\n2.  Next, we compute the semi-variance between the points using their observed values as $$\\begin{aligned}\\gamma(\\mathbf{s}, \\mathbf{s}+\\mathbf{h}) &= 0.5(Z(\\mathbf{s}) - Z(\\mathbf{s}+\\mathbf{h}))^2 \\\\ &= 0.5(315.33 - 306.9)^2 = 35.53\\end{aligned}$$\n\n3.  We repeat this process for every possible pair of points, and plot $h$ against $\\gamma(\\mathbf{s}, \\mathbf{t})$ for each.\n\nWe can calculate the empirical variogram for the data using the `variogram` function from the `gstat` library. (we first need to convert our data to a `sf` spatial object). This plot shows the semi-variances for each pair of points.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Empirical variogram values corresponding to the rainfall data in Paraná state, Brazil.](notes_8_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-4-1.pdf){fig-align='center'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that when we truncate the range of lag distances at which we consider spatial dependence to occur (see `max.dist` or `cutoff` for `geoR` and `gstat` respectivey in the R code above). Typically you would like set this value to approximately $1/2$ to $2/3$ of the total distance observed to ensure reliable estimates of spatial dependence. Beyond this, the number of point pairs available to estimate spatial dependence decreases (many points lack enough distant neighbors) leading to **biased estimates** of spatial dependence.\n\n::: callout-note\n## Directional variograms\n\nThe variograms assumed *isotropy* - no directionality in spatial dependence. We can subset our data based on direction (e.g., calculating four variograms for the $0^\\circ$ , $45^\\circ$ , $90^\\circ$ , $135^\\circ$ directions where $0^\\circ$ cover the range from $-22.5 \\text{ to }22.5 ^\\circ$) to visually consider whether there might be evidence for anisotropy in spatial dependence.\n\n![](images/direc_variogram.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"260\"}\n\nA strong difference in the empirical directional variograms indicate that anisotropy might be occurring in the data. Typically only 4 directions are considered (with windows $22.5^\\circ$) since any larger values (e.g., between 180 and 360 ) will provide the same patterns because the semivariance formula is symmetric.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"false\"}\n emp4.geoR <- variogram(value~1, \n               data = parana_sf,\n               cutoff=400,\n               alpha = c(0, 45, 90, 135)) # specify the degree to subset the data\n \n plot(emp4.geoR,multipanel=FALSE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](notes_8_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-5-1.pdf){fig-align='center' fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe directional variograms suggests anisotropy in the process of interest.\n:::\n\nTo make the variogram easier to use and interpret, we divide the distances into a set of discrete bins, and compute the average semi-variance in each. We compute this binned empirical variogram as: $$\\gamma(\\mathbf{h}) = \\frac{1}{2N(h_k)}\\sum_{(\\mathbf{s},\\mathbf{t}) \\in N(h_k)}[z(\\mathbf{s}) - z(\\mathbf{t})]^2$$\n\nIn`gstat`, we simply set the option `cloud = FALSE` (which is the default setting):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"false\"}\nvario_binned <- gstat::variogram(value ~ 1, \n                                 data = parana_sf,\n                                 cloud = FALSE,\n                                 cutoff = 400)\nplot(vario_binned)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Averaged empirical variogram values corresponding to the rainfall data in Paraná state, Brazil.](notes_8_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-6-1.pdf){fig-align='center' fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce we have computed an empirical variogram, we can constuct null envelope based on permutations of the data values across the locations, i.e. envelopes built under the assumption of no spatial correlation. By overlapping these envelopes with the empirical variograms we can determine whether there is some spatial dependence in our data ,e.g. if our observed variograms falls outside of the envelopes constructed under spatial randomness.\n\nWe can construct permutation envelopes on the `gstat` empirical variogram using the `envelope` function from the `variosig` R package.

Given our spatial region of interest $D$, We want to include a spatial random effect in the model because we believe there is *some relationship* between location and our response variable, but we don't know exactly what that relationship is. Since there are an infinite number of locations in $D$, there are an infinite number of possible values that $f$ could take. A random field can be thought of as defining a distribution on what functions $f$ can be. Recall that a GRF is essentially nothing more than a rule to define the joint distribution of the values of $f$ for any (finite) collection of locations.\n:::\n\n### Stationary and isotropy\n\nOur geostatistical process can be described as **weakly stationary** if the following criteria are met:\n\n1.  $E[{Z(\\mathbf{s})}] = \\mu_z(\\mathbf{s}) = \\mu_z$ - a finite constant which does not depend on $\\mathbf{s}$.\n\n2.  $C_z(\\mathbf{s}, \\mathbf{s+h}) = C_z(\\mathbf{h})$ - a function that depends only on the lag $\\mathbf{h}$ and not on the absolute location.\n\n-   Condition 1 states that our mean function must be constant in space, with no overall spatial trend. We typically assume that after accounting for the deterministic part of the model $\\mathbb{E}[Z(\\mathbf{s})] = 0$\n\n-   Condition 2 states that for any two locations, their covariance depends only on how far apart they are (their **spatial lag**, $h$), not their absolute position.\n\nA geostatistical process is said to be **isotropic** if the covariance function is *directionally invariant*. This means that the covariance between two points a distance $h$ apart is the same no matter which direction you travel in.\n\nMathematically, this can be denoted by $$C_z(\\mathbf{h}) = C_z(||\\mathbf{h}||).$$\n\n## Defining the Gaussian Field in a model\n\nThe first step in defining a model for a random field in a hierarchical framework is to identify a probability distribution for the observations available at $m$ sampled spatial locations and represented by the vector $\\mathbf{y} = y_1,\\ldots,y_m$.\n\nFor example, if we assume our observations follow a Gaussian distribution then\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nY_i &\\sim N(\\mu_i,\\tau_e^{-1}) \\text{ or } Y_i = \\mu_i + \\varepsilon_i ~~ \\varepsilon \\sim N(0,\\tau_e^{-1})\\\\\n\\eta_i &=\\mu_i = \\beta_0 + \\ldots + z(\\mathbf{s}_i)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n-   $\\tau_e^{-1} = \\sigma^2_e$ represents the variance of the zero-mean measurement error (equivalent to the nugget effect)\n\n-   The response mean $\\mu_i$ which coincides with the linear predictor $\\eta_i$ is defined based on:\n\n    -   the intercept $\\beta_0$ and any additional covariates\n\n    -   the realization of the latent (*unobservable*) GF $Z(\\mathbf{s}) \\sim \\mathrm{MVN}(0,\\Sigma)$ which accounts for the spatial correlation through $\\Sigma = C_z(\\cdot,\\cdot)$.\n\n### Finite basis representation\n\nAt first glance, implementing such a model in practice can seem challenging. We operate in a world with limited computational power and finite memory, so working with fully general function spaces is not feasible. To make the problem manageable, we restrict the function space for $f$. In other words, we define a set of possible functions using a finite collection of basic “building blocks.”\n\nIn practice, for Gaussian random fields (GRFs), we instead choose a finite basis and write\n\n$$\nf(\\mathbf{s}) = \\sum_{j=1}^M z_j \\phi_j(\\mathbf{s}),\n$$\\\nwhere $\\phi_1, \\ldots, \\phi_M$ known (non-random) functions and coefficients $\\mathbf{z}_1, \\ldots, \\mathbf{z}_M$ that we wish to estimate. Under this setup, defining a GRF is equivalent to specifying a joint probability distribution for the coefficient vector $\\mathbf{z}= [z_1, \\ldots, z_M]^\\intercal$. In summary, practical modelling requires restricting functions to finite bases for computational tractability, which leads us to place distributions on coefficients and carefully manage covariance or precision structures. This naturally highlights the importance of selecting a sensible covariance function, as it determines the dependence structure, computational efficiency, and ultimately how well the model captures the underlying spatial process.\n\n## The Matérn Field\n\nA commonly used covariance function is the Matérn covariance function. The covariance of two points which are a distance $h$ apart is:\n\n$$\n    \\Sigma =C_{\\nu}(h) = \\sigma^2 \\frac{2^{1-\\nu}}{\\Gamma(\\nu)} \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{2\\nu} h}{\\rho} \\right)^{\\nu} K_{\\nu} \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{2\\nu} h}{\\rho} \\right)\n$$ {#eq-matern}\n\n-   $\\Gamma(\\cdot)$ is the gamma function\n\n-   $K_{\\nu}(\\cdot)$ is the modified Bessel function of the second kind.\n\n-   Parameters $\\sigma^2$, $\\rho$ and $\\nu$ are non-negative values of the covariance function.\n\n    -   $\\sigma^2$ is the *spatially structured* variance component\n\n    -   $\\rho$ is the range of the spatial process\n\n    -   $\\nu$ controls smoothness of the spatial process.\n\n**Big *n* problem!**\n\nThe disadvantage of the modelling approach involving the spatial covariance function is known as \"big *n* problem\" and concerns the computational costs required for algebra operations with dense covariance matrices (such as $\\Sigma$).\n\nIn particular dense matrix operations scale cubically with the matrix size, given by the number of locations where the process is observed. Various approximation techniques have therefore been developed to address this issue; for example, the `mgcv` framework often uses low-rank approximations for smoothing splines.\n\nThe key to the approach in INLA is to avoid using the covariance matrix as much as possible and to instead work with the precision matrix. INLA deals with the computational challenges of GRFs by considering fields with sparse precision matrices. Such fields are Gaussian *Markov* random fields!. This is the basis for the main approach we will discuss, where a computationally efficient alternative is provided by the SPDE approach for representing GRFs as GMRFs.\n\n## The SPDE approach\n\nThe SPDE approach to modelling GMRFs was introduced by Lindgren et. al. ([2011](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9868.2011.00777.x)), and defines a (Matérn) GRF as the solution of a stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE)\n\n$$\n(\\kappa^2-\\Delta)^{\\alpha/2}Z(s) = W(s)\n$$\n\nWhat is this?\n\n-   $W(s)$ is random noise\n-   $Z(s)$ is the smooth process we want\n-   $(\\kappa^2-\\Delta)^{\\alpha/2}$ is an operator that \"*smooths*\" the white noise.\n-   $\\kappa$ and $\\alpha$ are parameters\n\n\"solving the SPDE\" means Find a random function $Z(t)$ such that the equality $(\\kappa^2-\\Delta)^{\\alpha/2}Z(t) = W(t)$ holds in distribution. Lindgren et. al. ([2011](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9868.2011.00777.x)) represent the solution as\n\n$$\nZ(t) = \\sum_{i = 1}^T\\psi_i(t)w_i\n$$\n\nWhere\n\n-   $\\psi_i(s)$ are (known) basis functions for nodes $i=1,\\ldots,T$\n\n    -   $\\psi_i(s_i)= 1$\n    -   $\\psi_i(s_j) = 0 ~~\\forall~~i \\neq j$\n    -   Linear between neighboring nodes\n\n-   $w_i$ are (unknown) weights\n\n    -   the field value $Z(s)$ is a **linear interpolation** between the two neighboring weights\n\nThis solution, which completely defined by a Gaussian vector of weights with zero mean and a sparse precision matrix, is approximated using a finite combination of piece-wise linear basis functions.\n\nIn practice, we approximate the GRF using a triangulated mesh. Then, the SPDE approach represents the continuous spatial process as a continuously indexed Gaussian Markov Random Field (GMRF). In other words, we construct an appropriate lower-resolution approximation of the surface by sampling it in a set of well designed points and constructing a piece-wise linear interpolant.\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=\"false\"}\nThe solution, as presented in Lindgren et. al.

This includes the spatial GF and all potential covariates\n\n4.  Define the observation model\n\n### 1. The mesh {.unnumbered}\n\nFirst, we need to create the mesh used to approximate the random field. For this purpose we use the function `fm_mesh_2d` from the `fmesher` package. One way to build the mesh is to start from the locations where we have observations, these are contained in the dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(fmesher)\nlibrary(inlabru)\nlibrary(INLA)\n\nmesh <- fm_mesh_2d(\n  loc = parana_sf,\n  offset = c(50, 100),\n  cutoff = 1,\n  max.edge = c(30, 60)\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere\n\n-   `max.edge` for maximum triangle edge lengths\n-   `offset` for inner and outer extensions (to prevent *edge effects*)\n-   `cutoff` to avoid overly small triangles in clustered areas\n\nYou can use the `plot(mesh)` function to visualize the mesh.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](notes_8_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-11-1.pdf)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: callout-note\n**General guidelines for creating the mesh**\n\n1.

Define the SPDE representation of the spatial GF {.unnumbered}\n\nTo define the SPDE representation of the spatial GF we use the function `inla.spde2.pcmatern`. This takes as input the mesh we have defined and the PC-priors definition for $\\rho$ and $\\sigma$ (the range and the marginal standard deviation of the field).\n\nPC priors Gaussian Random field are defined in (Fuglstad et al. 2018). From a practical perspective for the range $\\rho$ you need to define two paramters $\\rho_0$ and $p_{\\rho}$ such that you believe it is reasonable that\n\n$$\nP(\\rho<\\rho_0)=p_{\\rho}\n$$\n\nwhile for the marginal variance $\\sigma$ you need to define two parameters $\\sigma_0$ and $p_{\\sigma}$ such that you believe it is reasonable that\n\n$$\nP(\\sigma<\\sigma_0)=p_{\\sigma}\n$$\n\nThe Paraná state is around 663.8711 kilometers width by 464.7481 kilometers height. The PC-prior for the practical range is built considering the probability of the practical range being less than a chosen distance. We chose to set the prior considering the median as 100 kilometers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nspde_model =  inla.spde2.pcmatern(mesh,\n                                  prior.sigma = c(1, 0.5),\n                                  prior.range = c(100, 0.5))\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### 3.
