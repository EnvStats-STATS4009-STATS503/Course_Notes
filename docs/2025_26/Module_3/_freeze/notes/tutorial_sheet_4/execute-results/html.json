A positive correlation in the plot suggests **spatial clustering** (similar values are located near each other), while a negative correlation indicates **spatial dispersion** (neighboring values tend to be dissimilar). The slope of the regression line through the points provides an estimate of **Moran\\'s I**, a statistic that quantifies the degree of spatial autocorrelation.\n:::\n\n\n\n## Task 1 {.unnumbered}\n\n\nDefine what is meant by the term neighbourhood matrix and discuss two approaches for defining it, giving a drawback of each\n\n## Task 2 {.unnumbered} \n\nComment on the spatial variability in CDOM for this lake, with specific reference to the Moran\\'s I plot\n\n\n## Task 3 {.unnumbered} \n\n In your own words what does the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP) refers to?\n \n \n## Task 4 {.unnumbered} \n \n@fig-Penn shows the number of lung cancer cases in Pennsylvania per county, USA, in 2002.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Number of Lung Cancer cases in Pennsylavnia counties in 2002](tutorial_sheet_4_files/figure-html/fig-Penn-1.png){#fig-Penn width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Interpret the map , what does this tells you about the number of lung cancer cases?\n\n2. In addition to the number of cases, the data set contains county-level information of the following variables:\n\n- Expected number of cases $E_i$ computed as $E_i = \\sum_{j=1}^{m} r_j \\times n_j$ ( $r_j$ is rate of disease and $n_j$ the population  in stratum $j$)\n- Overall county smoking rate\n\nPropose a reasonable spatially explicit model to assess the relationship between lung cancer risk and smoking.\n\n\n\n\n#  Geostatistics\n\n## Task 5 {.unnumbered}\n\n Suppose we have a geostatistical process, $\\{Z(s); s \\in D\\},~ D \\subset\\mathbb{R}^2$ which is stationary with mean, $\\mu_z$ and covariance $\\mathrm{Cov}(h)$.
