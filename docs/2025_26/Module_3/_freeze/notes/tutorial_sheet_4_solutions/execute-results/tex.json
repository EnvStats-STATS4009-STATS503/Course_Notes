A positive correlation in the plot suggests **spatial clustering** (similar values are located near each other), while a negative correlation indicates **spatial dispersion** (neighboring values tend to be dissimilar). The slope of the regression line through the points provides an estimate of **Moran's I**, a statistic that quantifies the degree of spatial autocorrelation.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-warning icon=\"false\"}\n## {{< bi pencil-square color=#c8793c >}} Task 1\n\nDefine what is meant by the term neighbourhood matrix and discuss two approaches for defining it, giving a drawback of each\n\n\n<div class='webex-solution'><button>Solution</button>\n\n\n1.  **Binary:** Set the *ijt*h element $w_{ij}$ of $W$ equal to 1 if areas (i; j) share a common border and equal to zero otherwise.\n\n    -   Disadvantages: For small geographical units this can lead to two units being close together but not treated as being spatially close. Length of shared border is not accounted for.\n\n    -   Advantage: Don't need to specify a distance (but there are options of what constitutes a common border if regular shaped grid data, like pixels are used)\n\n2.  **Distance:** Set $w_{ij} = 1$ if the distance between the central points of each unit is less than a pre-specified threshold $d$, and $w_{ij} = 0$ otherwise.\n\n    -   Disadvantages; Threshold $d$ is arbitrary and needs to be chosen by the user, how do we choose d?\n\n    -   Advantages: small geographical units can be neighbours if close together but do not share a common border.\n\n\n</div>\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-warning icon=\"false\"}\n## {{< bi pencil-square color=#c8793c >}} Task 2\n\nComment on the spatial variability in CDOM for this lake, with specific reference to the Moran's I plot (@fig-moransi).\n\n\n<div class='webex-solution'><button>Solution</button>\n No evidence of spatial correlation in the dataset using the Moran's I plot.

The MAUP can lead to different results depending on the scale of the analysis.

Overall, lung cancer cases are unevenly distributed, with certain areas experiencing significantly higher concentrations than others.\n\n2.  A possible LGM for disease risk modelling could be a BYM with the following structure:\n\n-   **observational model**: $Y_i \\sim \\mathrm{Poisson}(\\theta_i \\times E_i)$, where $Y_i$ represent the number of cases, $\\theta_i$ is the relative risk, and $E_i$ the expected number of cases\n\n-   **the latent field** where the latent components of our model's linear predictor are linked to the RR as $\\log (\\theta_i) = \\alpha_0 +\\beta_1 \\text{smoking rate}_i +u_i +v_i$ where $\\exp(\\alpha)$ is the baseline lung cancer relative risk, $\\beta_1$ is the smoking effect , $v_i$ represents an unstructured spatial effects and $u_i$ is an iCAR component representing the spatially structured variability.\n\n-   the **hyperparameters**: the precision (or variance) parameters of the unstructured and structured spatial effects $\\tau_u,\\tau_v$\n\n\n</div>\n\n:::\n\n# Geostatistics\n\n::: {.callout-warning icon=\"false\"}\n## {{< bi pencil-square color=#c8793c >}} Task 5 {.unnumbered}\n\nSuppose we have a geostatistical process, $\\{Z(s); s \\in D\\},~ D \\subset\\mathbb{R}^2$ which is stationary with mean, $\\mu_z$ and covariance $\\mathrm{Cov}(h)$.

Mathematically, a geostatistical process $\\{Z(s); s \\in D\\},~ D \\subset\\mathbb{R}^2$ is weakly stationary if:\n\n-   $E[Z(s)] = \\mu_z(s) = \\mu_z$ for some finite constant $\\mu_z$ which does not depend on $s$.\n-   $\\mathrm{Cov}[Z(s),Z(s+h)] = C_z(s,s+h) = C_z(h)$, a finite constant that can depend on *h* but not on *s*.\n\nAn isotropic geostatistical process is a stationary process (i.e., the mean is constant, and the covariance only depends on the spatial lag and not the values themselves), but where the covariance between points only depends on the distance between the points, and not the direction. Mathematically, a weakly stationary geostatistical process $\\{Z(s); s \\in D\\}$ is isotropic if the covariance function $C_z(h)$ can be further simplified to $C_z(h) = C_Z(||h||)$; where $h=||h||$ denotes the length of the lag vector $h$.\n\nAssuming $Z(s)$ is stationary at lag $h$ we have\n\n$$\n    \\begin{aligned}\n    \\rho_z(h)&= \\dfrac{\\mathrm{Cov}[Z(s),Z(s+h)]}{\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Cov}[Z(s)]\\mathrm{Cov}(Z(s+h)]}}\\\\\n    &= \\dfrac{C_z(h)}{\\sqrt{C_z(0)C_z(0)}}\\\\\n    &= \\dfrac{C_z(h)}{C_z(0)}\n    \\end{aligned}\n    $$\n\n\n</div>\n\n:::\n\n@fig-Q5_a below shows summary plots for measurements of a geostatistical process, namely levels of Nitrogen measured at different locations across Chesapeake Bay, USA.\n\n![Summary plots for nitrogen levels across Chesapeake bay.

It is possible a transformation could be applied to stabilize the variance (e.g., a log transformation).

To assess spatial correlation we could:\n\n-   Compute semi-variance for nitrogen levels for all pairs of points and plot (variogram cloud)\n-   Bin the variogram cloud to obtain empirical variogram\n-   Construct null envelops under the assumption of no spatial autocorrelation and check for deviations from this assumption.\n\nA possible geostatistical model that accounts for spatial autocorrelation could take the form\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\log(\\text{nitrogen})_i &\\sim \\mathrm{Normal}(\\mu_i,\\sigma^2_e)\\\\\n\\mu_i & =\\beta_0 + Z(s)\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n$$ Here, the log concentrations are assumed to follow a Gaussian distribution with an observational error $\\sigma^2_e$ and mean $\\mu_i$ which is linked to the latent components $\\beta_0$ ,representing the mean nitrogen concentration levels (on the log scale), and $Z(s)$ - an mean-zero isotropic and stationary Gaussian Field with a variance-covariance matrix (e.g., a Matérn covariance) that accounts for the spatial correlation. $Z(s)$ can be then approximated as a continuously indexed a Gaussian Markov Random field using the stochastic partial differential equation approach (SPDE).\n\n\n</div>\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-warning icon=\"false\"}\n## {{< bi pencil-square color=#c8793c >}} Task 8 {.unnumbered}\n\nAn empirical semi-variogram with a MC envelope is shown below (@fig-Q5c).

This envelope corresponds to the range of plausible semi-variograms that could be produced if the data contained no spatial correlation. Therefore, if the empirical semi-variogram that is calculated from the real data lies completely within the envelopes, then there is no evidence of spatial correlation. If they lie outside at some point then there is evidence of correlation.\n\n\n</div>\n\n:::\n\n# Point Processes\n\n::: {.callout-warning icon=\"false\"}\n## {{< bi pencil-square color=#c8793c >}} Task 9 {.unnumbered}\n\nExplain what a spatial point pattern is, define complete spatial randomness, and how it is assessed.\n\n\n<div class='webex-solution'><button>Solution</button>\n *A Spatial point process is a set of locations, irregularly distributed within a designated region and presumed to have been generated by some form of stochastic (random) mechanism* - A realisation from a spatial point process is termed a spatial point pattern -- a countable collection of points $x_i$.\n\nGiven any spatial region A, CSR asserts that\n\ni.
