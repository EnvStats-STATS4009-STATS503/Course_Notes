Be aware of practical challenges that might impact the subsequent analysis such as: accessibility contains to the selected sampling site, landowner permission, safety issues, unfavorable environmental conditions, etc.\n\nOften statisticians will not actually carry out the sampling, but will instead rely on field experts in many cases. Once we receive the data, it’s important to assess the data for censoring, outliers, missingness. We can then fit an appropriate statistical model. Finally, we should report our results in clear language, including uncertainty where appropriate.\nIn this session we will look at different sampling schemes commonly used in environmental and ecological monitoring. A sampling strategy integrates both sample selection methods from a target population and estimation techniques to infer population attributes from sample measurements.\nSuch attributes can be viewed as a quantitative combination of population values such as the mean Orthophosphate \\([\\text{PO}_4]^{3-}\\) concentration or the total number of macroinvertebrates in a river. Likewise, an estimator is a mathematical expression or a function of the sample that provide us with a estimate of the population parameter. For instance, let \\(\\theta\\) denote the population parameter of interest (e.g., the population mean), then \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) represents its estimator (see [additional notes]{about.qmd} on estimator properties). Typically, the value of \\(\\theta\\) is unknown and it is unfeasible to measure all \\(N\\) elements of the population. Thus, we select and measure \\(n &lt; N\\) units to estimate \\(\\theta\\). The question now is how do we select such units?"

This requires us to have a complete list of the population members, or a sampling frame covering the entire region. We then generate a set of \\(n\\) random digits which identify the individuals or objects to be included in a study.\nFor a sample of size \\(n\\), denoted \\(y_1, \\ldots, y_n\\), we can compute the sample mean as \\[\\bar{y} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n y_i}{n}.\\]\nWe can then compute the estimated population variance as \\[s^2 =\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\bar{y})^2}{n-1}.\\]\nAs well as estimating the population mean and variance, we also have to think about the uncertainty surrounding these estimates. This is what a confidence interval is typically representing.\nOur sample of size \\(n\\) is just one of many possible samples of size \\(n\\) which we could have obtained. We must take this into account when considering the uncertainty associated with our sample mean. This is known as sampling variability. We can compute this as: \\[Var({\\bar{y}}) = \\frac{s^2}{n}\\left(1 - \\frac{n}{N}\\right).\\] Here, \\((1 - \\frac{n}{N})\\) is what is known as a finite population correction (FPC), which accounts for the proportion of the data that remains unknown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Task 1\n\n\n\nTo monitor patterns of weekly water consumption, a town conducted a SRS of \\(n=100\\) homes. The town records showed that there were \\(N=5392\\) residential dwellings with water meter in town. Water consumption was recorded in 100-gallon units. The sample average consumption was \\(\\bar{y} = 12.5\\) 100-gallons units per week and the sample variance was \\(s^2 = 1352\\) (100-gallon units)\\(^2\\). The local authority is interested in estimating the town’s total weekly residential water usage. An unbiased estimator of a population total under SRS was given by Horvitz-Thompson (1963) as:\n\\[\n\\hat{\\tau} = N\\bar{y}\n\\tag{1}\\]\nUsing HT estimator, calculate the town’s total weekly residential water consumption.

Divide the dataset of size \\(N\\) into \\(L\\) non-overlapping strata such that within-strata variability is less than between-strata variability. We then ensure that each of our strata are represented in our sample, and take this into account in our final estimates.\nWe ensure that each of these strata are represented proportionally within our sample (known as proportional allocation).

    "section": "\n3.4 Spatial Sampling",
    "text": "3.4 Spatial Sampling\nSpatial sampling is required when our data have an attribute that is spatially continuous. For example, if we are measuring water quality in a lake, we may have a three-dimensional coordinate system of length, width and depth. In some cases, it is possible to measure at any one of these locations, and simple random sampling or stratified sampling can be used. There are many examples where it is not possible or convenient to do so, in which case some form of systematic sampling may be used.\nSpatial sampling often uses a systematic sampling scheme based on transects. A transect is a straight line along which samples are taken. The starting point, geographical orientation and number of samples are chosen as part of the sampling scheme. Samples will then be either taken at random points along the length of the line (continuous sampling) or systematically placed points (systematic sampling).\nSuppose we need to take samples of water quality on a lake. Our sampling scheme may use multiple transects simultaneously.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4.1 Distance sampling\n\nIn ecology, distance sampling, is a widely used spatial sampling method for estimating animal abundance or population density by measuring the perpendicular distances from a transect line or point to detected individuals Figure 1 . The methods assumes that the probability of observing animals decreases with increasing distance from the observer according to a specific detection function. The distance data are modelled using this detection function to account for imperfect detection and estimate the proportion of missed individuals in the study area.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Illustration of a distance sampling scheme. On the left, the true species distribution point pattern, the vertical transects (dashed lines) and detected individuals along each transect (blue points). On the right hand side, the distribution of the observed distances from each transect to each detected individual.\n\n\n\n3.4.2 Quadrats\n\nIn some cases, we will instead be interested in trying to understand the frequency of a certain species across space. A quadrat is a tool used in ecology and other settings for this purpose. A series of squares (quadrats) of a fixed size are placed in the habitat of interest, and the species within the quadrats are counted. The number of quadrats, and their positions and orientations are chosen as part of the sampling scheme.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4.3 Grid Sampling\nIt may often be useful to use a regular grid to make sampling convenient and efficient. The grid is overlaid on the spatial region, and a fixed number of samples (usually one) is taken from each grids square. We choose the size of the grid such that the number of squares relates to the number of samples we require. For example, for a region of size 5km \\(\\times\\) 5km, choosing 1km \\(\\times\\) 1km grid squares would give us 25 squares in total.\nThere are a few different types of grid sampling.\n\n\nAligned Grid — we take a sample from the same (randomly selected) coordinates within each square.\n\nCentrally Aligned Grid — we take a sample from the central coordinates of each square.\n\nUnaligned Grid — each grid square has a sample taken from different randomly selected coordinates.\n\nTriangular Grid — this is a modified version of the aligned grid where the points are fixed based on a triangular arrangement.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe aligned and centrally aligned grids are convenient but may miss systematic patterns in the data. The unaligned grid avoids this, and combines the advantages of simple random sampling and stratified sampling. However, it can be inefficient for collection. The triangular grid can perform well in specific cases where the spatial correlation structures varies with direction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Exercise 1: Heights of trees\n\n\n\nAim: Estimate the average height of trees which are uniformly distributed within a 10 km\\(^2\\) forest.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the population here?\n\n\n\nSolution\n\nThe population is all trees in the forest.\n\n\nWhat are the sampling units?\n\n\n\nSolution\n\nOur sampling units are individual trees.\n\n\nWhat type of sampling scheme would be appropriate here?\n\n\n\nSolution\n\nSimple random sampling would likely be appropriate here, since it allows us to cover the large area of the forest at low “cost” (time and financial). The trees are uniformly distributed across the forest, so no need for strata. You could argue for systematic sampling using a grid or quadrats, but this may make analysis more complex.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Exercise 2: Chlorophyll-a in Lake Balaton\n\n\n\nAim: Estimate the average level of chlorophyll-a on Lake Balaton, Hungary. Levels are heavily affected by differences in the levels of nutrients along the length of the lake (known as a ‘trophic gradient’).\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the population here?\n\n\n\nSolution\n\nThe population is all possible water samples from the lake.\n\n\nWhat are the sampling units?\n\n\n\nSolution\n\nOur sampling units are individual water samples.\n\n\nWhat type of sampling scheme would be appropriate here?\n\n\n\nSolution\n\nStratified random sampling seems appropriate here due to heterogeneity in the lake. We could design transects which cover most regions of the lake. However, may be difficulty accessing all areas by boat. Also, there are potential issues with the boat itself disrupting the levels."

    "text": "4.1 Sample Size in Stratified sampling\nFor stratified sampling, this process is much more complicated. As well as considering the sample size, we also have to think about how to allocate our samples across the strata. A common approach is to specify a cost model, where we take into account the different costs of sampling each stratum. The aim is to minimize the estimated standard error for a given total cost.\nLet \\(C\\) be the overall cost, let \\(c_0\\) be the fixed overhead costs of the survey and let \\(c_l\\) be the cost per sample in stratum \\(l\\). Then our cost model is \\[C = c_0 + \\sum_{l=1}^L c_l n_l\\]\nTypically \\(C\\) is fixed, and the goal is to select the values of \\(n_l\\) which allow us to obtain the best possible estimate.\nNow let \\(\\omega_l = N_l/N\\) be the proportion of the overall population which is found within stratum \\(l\\). Also let \\(\\sigma_l\\) be the standard deviation for the population of stratum \\(l\\).\nWe can then compute the optimum number of samples in each stratum as \\[n_l = n\\frac{\\omega_l \\sigma_l /\\sqrt{c_l}}{\\sum_{k=1}^L \\omega_k \\sigma_k  /\\sqrt{c_k}}\\]\nIf the costs are the same for all strata, the equation simplifies to what is known as the Neyman allocation \\[n_l = n\\frac{\\omega_l \\sigma_l}{\\sum_{k=1}^L \\omega_k \\sigma_k}\\]\nWe often calculate \\(n\\) by a similar approach as that described for simple random sampling. In practice, the population standard deviation \\(\\sigma_l\\) is often replaced by the sample standard deviation, \\(s_l\\).\nWe now know how to determine the correct sample size to use to obtain estimates with the desired precision. This requires some advance knowledge, e.g. the tolerable level of error, the cost of the experiment, or the expected standard deviation. However, bear in mind that we have not considered the possibility of missing data in our sample, and losing some data will impact precision. We have also assumed all data points are independent, but this is not always true for time series or spatial data. (We will address this later in the course.)"

    "text": "5.1 Generalised Randomised Tessellation Stratified\nThe Generalised Randomised Tessellation Stratified (GRTS) is a form of spatially balanced probability sampling scheme introduced by Stevens and Olsen (2004). It has been widely used for monitoring extensive environmental resources by USEPA and Marine Scotland. It builds on random, systematic and stratified sampling procedures while ensuring spatial balance (where every replicate of the sample exhibits a spatial density pattern that resembles the spatial density pattern of the resource of interest). The GRTS algorithm can be implemented as follows:\n\nFirst one must determine the inclusion probability of each site/feature (e.g., trees, river breaches, lakes, etc.). For example, there are \\(N= 16\\) main lakes in the lake district and a sample of \\(n=4\\) is desired. Assuming equal sampling probabilities the inclusion probabilities are \\(n/N = 4/16 = 0.25\\) for each lake.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA square bounding box is superimposed onto the sampling frame and is divided into four equally sized square cells (level 1 cells). Each cell is then randomly labelled/numbered, e.g.,\\(\\mathcal{A}_1\\equiv \\{a_1:a_1 - 0,1,2,3\\}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach square is split into four more tessellations which are again randomly numbered while retaining the first-level label. The set of level-two cells is denoted by \\(\\mathcal{A}_2 \\equiv \\{a_1a_2 : a_1 = 0,1,2,3; ~a_2 = 0,1,2,3\\}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContinue this hierarchical randomisation to the desired spatial scale such that \\(\\mathcal{A}_k \\equiv \\{a_1,\\ldots,a_k:a_1 = 0,1,2,3; \\ldots; a_k = 0,1,2,3\\}\\) until the sum of the inclusion probabilities of each element within a given square are less than one (i.e., (Number of samples needed from this cell) / (Number of sites in this cell) &lt; 1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe elements (e.g., lakes) in \\(\\mathcal{A}_k\\) are placed in hierachichal order by sorting out \\(\\mathcal{A}_k\\) by the level 1 cells from smallest to largest, then by the level-two cells from smallest to largest, and so on. This will transform the level \\(k\\) grid cell to a one-dimensional number line. The length of each line-segment represents the inclusion probability for a given site (or lake in this example). Thus, the line’s total length equals the sum of these inclusion probabilities (the sum should equal \\(n\\) since we do not allow the inclusion value within a cell to be greater than one). Here we have colored cells contianing larger lakes in red and small lakes in blue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, we can use systematic sampling along the line to select the lakes to survey. E.g., you can randomly draw \\(u_1\\) from an uniform [0,1] and place it on a line. Imagine we draw \\(u_1 = 0.53\\), then location of \\(u_1\\) on the line falls within some line segment that represents a site, which we denote \\(s_1\\) (in the example this is the lake in cell 010). We include this sites as our first site in the sample and then continue with the next \\(j\\) sites by setting \\(u_j = u_{j-1} +1\\) for \\(j = 2,\\ldots,n\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuppose we would like larger lakes to be twice as likely to be selected as small lakes. Thus, instead of given all lakes the same unit length we can give large lakes twice the unit length of small lakes.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to unequal inclusion probabilities we can also perform stratified sampling. Thus, instead of sampling from the entire sampling frame simultaneously, we divide a sampling frame into distinct sets of sites and select samples from each stratum independently of other strata -we apply the GRTS algorithm to obtain stratum-specific sample sizes. The R-package spsurvey implements GRTS algorithm to select spatially balanced samples via the grts() function."

    "text": "5.2 Before-after-Impact approaches\nThe purpose of monitoring is to assess the changes in a particular variable over time. This can typically be carried out using standard statistical techniques, taking into account the structure of the data. Sometimes we are interested in whether a specific event has had an impact on the variable, e.g., the effect of new regulations on the air pollution level. Typically this involves assessing the levels before and after the event.\nIt is generally very difficult to untangle the effects of a single event. Even if we identify a change in the mean or variance, how do we know that it is due to our event? Many environmental systems change naturally over time for any number of reasons. We do not have a statistical control, meaning that we can’t turn back the clock and check what would have happened without the event.\nHowever, this challenge is not unique to environmental data. We face it regularly in statistics. Often, we are only interested in the effect of one particular variable, but we have to account for other nuisance variables via regression or other techniques. We can also sometimes account for other unmeasured variability through random effects. The key is to acknowledge what you do and don’t know, and to account properly for uncertainty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Examples: Before-After Designs\n\n\n\n\nBefore-After Single Site\n\nOften, we wish to assess the impact of an intervention on a site, but we only have data for that site.\n\n\nLine graph of value by time, illustrating the impact of an intervention. The blue arrows represent the time “before” the intervation and the red arrows represent the time “after” the intervantion.\n\nWe can fit a statistical model, such as: \\[X_{ik} = \\mu + \\alpha_i + \\tau_{k(i)} + \\varepsilon_{ik}\\] with \\(\\mu\\) representing the overall mean, \\(\\alpha_i\\) the effect of period (before/after), \\(\\tau_{k(i)}\\) the time within period, and \\(\\varepsilon_{ik}\\) the errors.\nThis is not an ideal design, since we have no control to compare to.\n\nBefore-After Multiple Sites\n\nWe can sometimes improve upon the Before-After Single Site design, if we can collect data at multiple \\(j=1,\\ldots,M\\) sites that are likely to be impacted by the intervention. We can fit a statistical model, such as:\n\\[\nX_{ijk} = \\mu + \\alpha_i + \\tau_{jk(i)} + \\delta_j + \\varepsilon_{ijk},\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\mu\\) is the overall mean; \\(\\alpha_i\\) is the effect of period (before/after); \\(\\tau_{jk(i)}\\) represents the time within the ith period; \\(\\delta_j\\) is the site \\(j\\) random effect and \\(\\varepsilon_{ijk}\\) are the sampling errors.\n\n\nLine graph of value by time, illustrating the impact of an intervention. Each line connects the data points for a single site.\n\nTreating the sites as subsamples allows the sites to be used to improve estimation of the effect’s magnitude, compared to a single site design.\n\nBefore-After Control-Impact (BACI)\n\nBACI is a common design, where one or more potentially impacted sites, and one or more sites that are thought not vulnerable to impact, are sampled before and after the time of the intervention.\n\n\nLine graph of value by time, illustrating the impact of an intervention on the “impact” site. The two lines connect the data points for two sites (one impact site and one control site).\n\nWe can fit a statistical model, such as: \\[X_{ij} = \\mu + \\alpha_i + \\beta_j + (\\alpha\\beta)_{ij} + \\varepsilon_{ij}\\] with \\(\\mu\\) representing the overall mean, \\(\\alpha_i\\) the effect of period (before/after), \\(\\beta_j\\) the effect of location (control/impact), and \\(\\varepsilon_{ik}\\) the errors.\nHaving the control sites allows us to better assess whether any impacts are caused by the intervention."

This includes detecting and modelling environmental trends, including trends in time and space, modelling and understanding extreme data. We also wish to evaluate environmental regulation and policy, and risk assessment.\nWe want to understand changes in the environment, in either time, space or both. Are things getting better or worse? Where, when and by how much? What is going to happen next? Where do authorities need to take action, and how can we check if existing actions are working? Also, we should consider relationships between environmental variables (and other variables where necessary).\nIn general, there are no techniques that are unique to environmental statistics. However, the data used tend to be characterised by strong spatial and temporal elements, and often also high variability.\nOur skills in presenting and communicating data are also crucial. We need to be able to explain our findings to the public and show them why our work is important. Below is an example of reporting of a winter storm in 2023, which makes use of plots to tell the story.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The Courier article on Storm Babet\n\n\n\nOn 20th October 2023, The Courier published an article titled “Storm Babet: Timeline of devastating rainfall in charts and maps”.

Can we predict its level in 2060?\n\nRegulation: Have emission control agreements reduced air pollutants?\n\nUnderstanding: How did sea levels change over the past 100 years?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Example: Air quality\n\n\n\nWe will illustrate this with an example relating to air quality.\n\n\nPhoto of smog in Shanghai.\n\nOnly one person in ten lives in a city that complies with the World Health Organisation Air quality guidelines.\nFine particular matter was associated with an estimated 2,000 premature deaths and 22,500 lost life years in Scotland in 2010. There are 38 “Air Quality Management Areas” (AQMAs) which breach or are likely to breach legal limits. The Cleaner Air for Scotland strategy seeks to reduce air pollution across Scotland. It aims to achieve the “ambitious vision for Scotland to have the best air quality in Europe”.\nThere are 99 air quality monitoring stations in Scotland capturing PM\\(_{2.5}\\), PM\\(_{10}\\), NO\\(_2\\), NO\\(_\\text{X}\\), SO\\(_2\\) and O\\(_3\\).\n\nThe map below shows the placement of the monitors.

What information do we not have, which we would normally expect to see here?\n\n\nSolution\n\nThe main thing missing here is the lack of uncertainty information. It seems that most of the monitoring stations are in the Central Belt of Scotland (where most of the pollution might be expected), so we’d expect to see lower uncertainty there than in areas further from a monitoring station.\nWe might also like to know more about the temporal aspects of the data. Is the prediction map for the same time that the data were collected, or do frequencies of collection vary across the monitoring stations?\nAlso, are these predictions just from the station data, or do we have other sources that are combined with these? (For at least some variables, we might have satellite data available that provide us with measurements across a fine spatial grid, which we can combine with monitoring station data through “data fusion”.) In any case, we’d like to know how these predictions are made.\nYou may have thought of some other ideas too. We can discuss these in the lectures."

Some problems with this approach could be data availability over time (satellites or submarines not covering the whole area, or only at certain timepoints, and lack of data in earlier years), and the difficulty in estimating coverage at any timepoint from these measurements — statistical approaches would be vital to estimate this and the associated uncertainty.\nNote that the use of before and after images (like in the above example) might not be thought of as the best idea in statistics (since they could be misused, with particular years cherry-picked to back up an incorrect claim), but such images can be useful in illustrating a trend to the general public, as long as this is also presented with additional complete information about the general patterns."

    "text": "3 Understanding our data: trends\nMuch of the statistical analysis of environmental and ecological data will focus on identifying trends. The statistical definition of a trend is a long-term change in the mean level. Trends aren’t restricted to being linear, and we will also look at examples of non-linear trends, and changepoints.\nTrends generally tend to focus on the mean of the data. However, we may also be interested in observing other aspects of the statistical distribution. Extreme value theory looks specifically at the limits of our distribution, and focuses on rare (or extreme) events.\nWe’ll cover this more later in the course."

    "text": "4 Policy and legislation\nA great deal of environmental statistical research is funded by governments and regulatory bodies. They need to know where the biggest challenges lie so that they can allocate their resources appropriately. Evidence-based policy relies on measuring changes and also evaluating the impacts of existing policies. However, the environment will be one of many competing policy areas, and every government will prioritise it differently.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Example of international cooperation and negotiations: COP\n\n\n\n\n\nTeam photograph from COP28 in 2023.\n\nCOP is the United Nations Climate Change Conference that takes place annually (held in Glasgow in 2021), where most countries’ governments come together to try to agree on goals to limit global temperature rise and achieve net zero emissions. The most recent conference was COP29, which took place in Baku, Azerbaijan, in November 2024.\nOne of the key achievements of COP29 was an agreement by wealthier countries to pay at least US $300 billion per year to less wealthy countries to help finance their mitigation of climate change impacts, and to transform their economies away from fossil fuels. However, there was limited progress in other sectors.\nA report on COP29 and its implications for the UK is available from the UK’s Climate Change Committee here.\n\n\n\nEnvironmental policy tends to use very specific language: objectives, targets, guide values, standards, reductions relative to a baseline. Policy often prescribes monitoring quantities of interest over space and/or time. Quantities of interest include water, air and noise pollution, waste management, radioactive substances, biodiversity and animal and plant species.\nLegislation is the legal framework used to implement policy. Most legislation focuses on setting targets or safe levels for the pollutants. A number of regulatory bodies exist specifically to monitor such things, e.g. Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA, for Scotland), the Environment Agency (EA, for England) and the European Environment Agency (EEA, for the EU). As well as regulatory bodies, the Climate Change Committee advises governments within the UK on reducing emissions and addressing climate change impacts.\nMuch of our data come from routine monitoring of our environmental quantities of interest. Government agencies often make these data available to researchers and/or the public. These data are used to assess compliance with legislation as well as to identify environmental trends and their potential impacts on society.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Example of Natural Capital and Ecosystem Assessment (NCEA) programme\n\n\n\nThe UK Government’s Natural Capital and Ecosystem Assessment (NCEA) programme aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the state of the natural environment to inform better decision-making for its protection and enhancement. By integrating data collection, mapping, standardized protocols, and detailed reporting, the NCEA seeks to halt biodiversity loss, support climate adaptation and mitigation, and ensure sustainable management of natural capital for future generations. This evidence-based approach helps identify environmental trends, risks, and opportunities to guide policy and conservation efforts.\nThe brochure below provides an overview of some of the key resources produced by the NCEA.\n Download the NCEA brochure \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Exercise 6\n\n\n\nDownload the NCEA. brochure and read to three case studies and identify (1) the problem that is being address (2) the proposed solution and its (3) policy impact. Then, think about how would you present the data."

Do you notice any patterns or unusual observations?\n\n\nSee Solution\n\nWe would like to focus here on the relationship between Ammonia and time. The key thing that we notice is the single point that has a high value of Ammonia. This seems like it could be an error rather than a true value (possibly a decimal point in the wrong place). We can also see this by looking at the dataset — type View(Soar).\nWe could justify removing the outlier, since its value is an order of magnitude larger than the other values, so is probably an error. We could alternatively justify not removing the outlier, since we would need to first consult a subject-matter expert before concluding that it was an unlikely value of Ammonia. (It’s up to you which you choose, as long as you justify it. I might remove this value.)\nThere are no obvious trends or seasonal patterns in the data, from these plots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Task 1\n\n\n\nBy looking at the exploratory plots there seems to be an outlier given by an Ammonia value that is larger than 2. Suppose we want to remove this from any further analysis (provided we have reasonable justification to do it). Remove the outlier from the dataset, you can use the filter() function from the dplyr package to achieve this.\n\n\nTake hint\n\nWe can use the filter function from dplyr to subset our data according to a logical statement. Load the dplyr library and type ?filter for further details.\n\n\n\n\nClick here to see the solution\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nSoar &lt;- Soar %&gt;% filter(Ammonia &lt;2)\n\n\n\n\n\nLets look into some further statistics using the pctCen and censummary functions from NADA:\n\n# Further summary statistics:\npctCen(Soar$Ammonia, Soar$censored)     ## percent of censored data\n\n[1] 31.39013\n\ncensummary(Soar$Ammonia, Soar$censored) ## like summary cmd but for \n\nall:\n        n     n.cen   pct.cen       min       max \n223.00000  70.00000  31.39013   0.01200   0.27000 \n\nlimits:\n  limit  n uncen   pexceed\n1  0.00  0    22 1.0000000\n2  0.03 70   131 0.5874439\n\n                                        ## censored data\n\nWhat does this tell us? You can ignore the limit of “0.00”, since the function adds this by default if there is only one positive limit in the dataset — you can see that n takes the value 0 here, meaning that there are no data points censored at 0.\nIn the first line, uncen tells us that there are 22 data points that have values between 0 and the LoD of 0.03, so this emphasises that just because we have a LoD in the data, that doesn’t mean that all data points will be censored here, since different instruments (that have different LoDs) may have been used to generate the same dataset.\nIn the second line, we see that there are 70 data points censored at the LoD of 0.03. There are 131 data points that take values above 0.03. pexceed tells us that the probability of exceeding the LoD is \\(131/(131+70+22) = 0.589\\)."

    "section": "2.6 Assessing spatial balance",
    "text": "2.6 Assessing spatial balance\nA practical way to measure spatial balance was developed by Stevens and Olsen (2004) using Voronoi polygons. In this approach, each sampled site defines a region containing all locations closer to it than to any other sampled site. For a spatially balanced design, the total inclusion probability of all sites within each Voronoi polygon is expected to be 1. Deviation from this ideal can be quantified using a loss metric based on these polygon totals. One common choice is Pielou’s evenness index (PEI), which assesses how uniformly the inclusion probability is distributed across the sample sites. Pielou’s evenness index (PEI) is defined as:\n\\[\n\\text{PEI} = 1 + \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{v_i}{n} \\ln(v_i/n)}{\\ln(n)},\n\\]\nwhere \\(n\\) is the sample size. PEI is bounded between zero and one. A PEI of zero indicates perfect spatial balance. As PEI increases, the spatial balance worsens.

    "text": "2.1 Standard uncertainty and expanded uncertainty\nWhen presenting our results, it is important that we are clear the uncertainty associated with them. A common approach is to use a standard uncertainty, which is just the standard deviation, reported as: \\[\\text{estimated value } \\pm \\text{ standard uncertainty}\\]\nThe standard uncertainty (\\(u(\\bar{\\mathbf{x}})\\)) for a vector \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) of length \\(n\\) is computed as follows: \\[u(\\bar{\\mathbf{x}}) = \\frac{sd(\\mathbf{x})}{\\sqrt{(n)}}\\]\nMore generally we can use an expanded uncertainty, which is obtained by multiplying the standard uncertainty by a factor \\(k\\). You have already seen this in statistics as the key building block of a confidence interval. The value of \\(k\\) is chosen based on the quantiles of a standard normal distribution, with a value of \\(k=1.96\\) (or \\(k=2\\)) giving a 95% confidence interval. The 95% CI for the mean of \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) is given as \\(\\bar{\\mathbf{x}} \\pm 1.96 \\times u(\\bar{\\mathbf{x}}).\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Example: Bathing water quality\n\n\n\nAll bathing water sites in Scotland are classified by SEPA as “Excellent”, “Good”, “Sufficient” or “Poor” in terms of how much fecal bacteria (from sewage) they contain. The minimum standard all beaches or bathing water must meet is “Sufficient”. The sites are classified based on the 90th and 95th percentiles of samples taken over the four most recent bathing seasons.\nThe figure below shows the data from some selected sites.\n\n\nBoxplots of FS by year for 10 sites. The dashed horizontal lines represent “excellent” (green, lowest), “good” (blue, middle) and “sufficient” (red, highest) classification boundaries, respectively.\n\nThe classification is based on a belief that the samples at each site follow a log-normal distribution. If this assumption does not hold, then our classifications would not be accurate. Therefore, it is crucial that we regularly assess this assumption to ensure the safety of our bathing water. We can use our standard plots to assess log-normality. In the figure below, the top plots are produced using the untransformed data and the bottom plots are produced after taking a logarithmic transformation of the data (FS).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Exercise 2\n\n\n\nCan we assume that the samples at each site follow a log-normal distribution? \nYes\nNo\n\n\nSolution\n\nYes, we can assume that the samples at each site follow a log-normal distribution. From the plots, there is no strong evidence to suggest we have breached our assumptions. Specifically, the histogram of log\\(_{10}\\)(FS) shows that the distribution is not far from a bell shape, and the points on the Normal Q-Q plot lie close to the line of equality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Example: Bathing water quality (continued)\n\n\n\nIn the following exercises, we will calculate the standard uncertainty and a 95% confidence interval for the mean of log(FS).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Exercise 3\n\n\n\n\nWe have 80 measurements of log(FS), with a mean of 3.861 and a standard deviation of 1.427. Use these to calculate the standard uncertainty of the population mean log(FS) using our vector \\(\\textbf{x}\\).\n\nAnswer (to 3 decimal places): \n\n\nSolution\n\n\\[u = \\frac{sd(\\mathbf{x})}{\\sqrt{(n)}} = \\frac{1.427}{\\sqrt{80}} = 0.160\\]\n\n\nGiven the standard uncertainty that calculated in part (a), calculate a 95% confidence interval for the population mean of log(FS).\n\nAnswer (to 3 decimal places): (,)\n\n\nSolution\n\nA 95% confidence interval for \\(\\bar{x}\\) is: \\[\\bar{x} \\pm 1.96 \\times u = 3.861 \\pm 1.96 \\times 0.160 = (3.574, 4.175)\\]"

    "text": "3.2 Institutional Monitoring Programmes\nInstitutional Monitoring programmes have long been a primary source of information for long-term environmental assessment, producing structured datasets essential for detecting ecological change and informing evidence-based policy.\nThese initiatives rely field surveys conducted on established monitoring networks to track trends in species populations, habitat quality, and ecosystem processes - a topic we will explore in detail in the following session. Their strength lies in rigorous implementation of standardized sampling protocols, which reduces the observational errors associated with data collection methods. However, these are typically constrained by other factors. For example, large-scale programmes are inherently resource-intensive to maintain and often limited in taxonomic scope (typically focusing on key species), spatial/geographic coverage, and temporal resolution. Some popular monitoring schemes are shown below:\n\n\nMonitoring Scheme\nDescription\n\n\n\nUnited Kingdom Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS)\nProtocolized sampling scheme run by butterfly conservation that has monitored changes in the abundance of butterflies throughout the United Kingdom since 1976.\n\n\nUK Environmental Change Network (ECN)\nUK’s long-term ecosystem monitoring and research programme that has produced a large collection of publicly available data sets including meteorological, biogeochemistry and biological data for different taxonomic groups (Rennie et al. 2020).\n\n\nNational Hydrological Monitoring Programme (NHMP)\nThe NHMP, particulalry the National River Flow Archive conveys a national scale management of hydrological data within the UK hosted by the UKCEH since 1982 collating hydrometric data from gauging station networks operated by multiple agencies.\n\n\nNatural Capital and Ecosystem Assessment (NCEA)\nLong-term environmental monitoring of natural capital including data from freshwater Surveillance Networks, ecosystem condition & soil health, forest inventory, estuary and coast surveillance, etc.\n\n\nBreeding Bird Survey (BBS)\nMain scheme for monitoring the population changes of the UK’s common breeding birds.

A major issue with the lack of a standardized sampling protocol is that sampling efforts tend to be uneven over time and space and biased towards human activity centers, locations that are easy to access, or sites where species are more likely to be found such as protected area. If unaccounted for, such sources of bias can mislead Figure 2 (left) shows the sampling effort based on CS records submitted through the Pl@anet Net App in the French mediterranean region. If we compare the spatial effort against the elevation of the region we can clearly see that a sampling bias towards lower elevation values. This would imply that small populations at lower elevation could be over-sampled and if we had worngly assumed sampling was evenly distributed, then species distributions at higher elevation would be under-estimated.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Elevation versus sampling effort (obtained through the Pl@net Net App) in the French mediterranean region (Figure taken from Botella et al.

    "text": "3.6 Processed information products\n\nProcessed information products transform raw measurements into refined, analysis-ready resources tailored for decision-makers and researchers. Unlike primary data repositories, these products undergo rigorous calibration, integration, and modelling to generate authoritative maps, indicators, and synthesized datasets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Example: WorldClim\n\n\n\nWorldClim is a widely used set of global, high-resolution climate surfaces (raster maps) that provide interpolated estimates of historical and future projections (using global climate models CMIP ) of temperature, precipitation, and other bioclimatic variables. The historical data layers are generated by applying advanced spatial interpolation algorithms to an extensive global network of weather station records, creating continuous, gap-free rasters. These surfaces serve as the foundational data for species distribution modeling, ecological forecasting, and a vast range of other environmental research applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNowadays, it is common that contemporary data products are synthesized based on a combination of multiple data sources, including field surveys, citizen science and advanced remote sensing data from satellite and aerial platforms.\n\n3.6.1 Remote sensing\nRemote sensing refer the process of obtaining information of an object from a distance, typically from aircraft or satellites. Recent advances in bioinformatics, GIS technologies and remote sensing techniques have changed radically how we monitor the Earth’s environment at multiple spatial and temporal scales. These technologies enables the systematic, non-invasive, and often near-real-time collection of data across vast and inaccessible regions. The resulting data are then calibrated, classified, and modeled using specialized algorithms to generate diverse information products, such as land cover classifications, vegetation indices, and digital elevation models.\nWhile remote sensing-based products enable the quantification of ecological and environmental parameters across extensive geographic scales, they are often subject to substantial uncertainties. These include systematic errors from sensor calibration, spatial and temporal resolution constraints, and generally lower accuracy compared to direct in-situ field measurements. Consequently, remote sensing data are often validated using data collected in-situ to assess and ensure their accuracy. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n Example: Digital Elevation Models\n\n\n\nDigital Elevation Models (DEMs) are digital representations of the earth’s topographic surface. DEMs providing a continuous and quantitative model of terrain morphology and are typically stored as a raster grid where each cell (pixel) contains an elevation value. The accuracy of DEMs is determined primarily by the resolution of the model (the size of the area represented by each individual grid cell). For example, the\nShuttle RaDAR Topography Mission (SRTM), aquired by NASA using a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) instrument, provide elevation data for any country and is available from the geodata R package.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Example: Land Cover Maps\n\n\n\nLand cover maps describe the physical material on the Earth’s surface. They are created by applying automated algorithms to satellite or aerial imagery to identify features such as grassland, woodland, rivers & lakes or man-made structures such as roads and buildings.\nFor example, UK CEH has produced a series of Land Cover Maps which are a series of spatially continuous, raster-based classification products, derived from the automated analysis of Earth observation data (primarily from the Sentinel-2 satellite constellation), which provide consistent, national-scale representations of surface vegetation and land use classes.\n\n\n\n\nOther widely used global products include MODIS Land Cover, which offers a long-term, coarse-resolution record of global change since 2001, and ESA WorldCover, which provides a high-resolution (10m) global snapshot designed for detailed thematic mapping (the later is available on the geodata R package).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Example: NDVI Vegetation Index\n\n\n\nVegetation indeces derived from remote sensing utilize spectral data from satellite or aerial sensors to quantify and monitor plant health, structure, and function across landscapes. These indeces are founded on the principle that vegetation absorbs red light (around 660 nm) for photosynthesis while highly reflecting near-infrared (NIR) light (around 800 nm) due to its internal leaf structure.\nThis contrast is captured by the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), which is calculated as\n\\[\nNDVI = \\dfrac{(NIR- Red)}{(NIR - Red)}\n\\]\nThe resulting value, which ranges from -1 to +1, provides a standardized measure of greenness; values close to +1 indicate dense, healthy vegetation, values near 0 represent bare soil, and negative values typically correspond to water. By translating raw spectral data into this simple yet robust index, remote sensing enables the tracking of phenological cycles, the assessment of drought stress, and the estimation of primary productivity on a global scale."

By assigning persistent digital object identifiers (DOIs) to these materials, they create a permanent, citable record that allows other scientists to independently verify, replicate, and build upon published findings.

    "section": "\n4.1 Censored Data",
    "text": "4.1 Censored Data\nCensored data are data where we are restricted in our knowledge about them in some way or other. Often this will be because we only know that the data value lies below a certain minimum value (or above a certain maximum). For example, if we had scales which only weighed up to 10kg, we would not know the exact weight of any object greater than 10kg.\nFor environmental data, it is more common to have data which are censored at some minimum value. This is because many pieces of measuring equipment will have an analytical limit of detection. A limit of detection is the lowest concentration that can be distinguished with reasonable confidence from a blank (a hypothetical sample with a value of zero). The limit of detection is often denoted \\(c_L\\).\nCensoring has a huge impact on how we interpret our data. The two plots below show the same data, but the right panel is ‘censored’ with two different limits of detection (some with an LOD of 0.5, others with an LOD of 1.5).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCensored observations are not completely without information. We still know they are equal to or more extreme than the limit. For an LOD, we might therefore report the data point as either “not detected” or ‘\\(&lt; c_L\\)’. Removing them from our study would not be sensible, since this would lead to us overestimating the mean and probably also underestimating the variance. We therefore need to find a way to incorporate these censored data points into our analysis.\nWe can’t simply use the minimum value of the LOD. This would ignore the fact that the values are often below this. In the plot below, the LOD reduces after every 100 observations (e.g. because of better quality equipment), and this leads to an artificial trend.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1.1 Simple Substitution\nThe simplest approach for dealing with LODs is via simple substitution. This involves taking the LOD value and multiplying it by a fixed constant, e.g. by replacing all \\(&lt;c_L\\) values with \\(0.5c_L\\).\nThis approach is fairly popular because it is simple and easy to implement. However, it only works if there is a small proportion of censored data (maximum 10–15%). If there is a higher proportion, it tends to overestimate the mean.\n\n4.1.2 Distribution-based approaches\nIt is generally preferable to use a more statistics-based approach which accounts for the data distribution. The basic idea is that we estimate the statistical distribution of the data in a way that takes into account the censoring. We can then use this estimated distribution to simulate values for our censored points.\nCommonly used distribution-based approaches are Maximum Likelihood, Kaplan-Meier, and Regression on Order Statistics.\n\n4.1.2.1 Maximum Likelihood\nThe maximum likelihood approach is a parametric approach. It requires us to specify a statistical distribution which is a close fit to the data. We then identify the parameters of this distribution that maximize the likelihood of obtaining a dataset like ours.\nThis ML approach has to take into account the likelihood of obtaining:\n\nthe observed values in our dataset\nthe correct proportion of data being censored, i.e. the proportion falling below our detection limit(s)\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvantages\n\nAble to handle multiple limits of detection.\nGood for estimating summary statistics with a suitably large sample size.\nMLE explicitly accounts for the underlying distribution of the data (if known).\n\nDisadvantages\n\nMore applicable to larger datasets (n &gt; 50).\nReliant on specifying the correct distribution, otherwise estimates can be incorrect.\nTransforming data to fit a distribution can potentially cause biased estimators.\n\n4.1.2.2 Kaplan-Meier Approach\nThe Kaplan-Meier approach is a nonparametric approach. I.e., it doesn’t require a distributional assumption. It’s often used in survival analysis for estimating summary statistics for right-censored data. However, it can be applied to left-censored data by ‘flipping’ the data and subtracting from a fixed constant.\nIn survival analysis, Kaplan-Meier estimates the probability that an observation will survive past a certain time. In our ‘flipped’ context, it gives the probability that an observation will fall below the limit of detection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Example: Cadmium in fish\n\n\n\nWe can illustrate this using an example of cadmium levels in fish. Cadmium is a heavy metal identified as having potential health risks. We observe cadmium levels in fish livers in two different regions of the Rocky Mountains.\nDue to variation in data collection, there are four different LODs (0.2, 0.3, 0.4 and 0.6 \\(\\mu\\)g per litre).\n\n\n\n\nPlotting the data shows the potential impact of censoring. The left panel shows all the data (plotting censored values as equal to the LOD), while the right panel excludes those which have been censored.\n\n\n\n\nWe can use the NADA (Nondetects and Data Analysis) package in R. The cenfit function applies the Kaplan-Meier method. This package automatically ‘flips’ the data, since it is designed for environmental data.\n\nCodeblinky &lt;- cenfit(obs, censored, groups)\n\n\n           n  n.cen  median    mean      sd\ngroups=1   9      3     0.4   0.589   0.352\ngroups=2  10      1     3.0  10.540  25.069\nThere are clear differences between the locations in terms of both median and standard deviation.\nThe cendiff function tests for significant differences between the groups. This uses a chi-squared hypothesis test:\n\nH0: Median cadmium levels are the same in Region 1 and Region 2\nH1: Median cadmium levels are different in Region 1 and Region 2\n\n\nCodecendiff(obs, censored, groups)\n\n\n                N  Observed Expected (O-E)^2/E (O-E)^2/V\ngroups=1        9      2.84     6.13      1.76      7.02\ngroups=2        10     6.84     3.55      3.05      7.02\n\nChisq=7 on 1 degrees of freedom, p= 0.00808 \nWe can also plot the empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF), taking into account the LODs. Note that this works in the opposite direction from regular survival plots due to the ‘flipping’ of the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvantages\n\nNonparametric, so no need to assume underlying distribution.\nCan easily account for multiple LODs.\nWorks for large numbers of censored datapoints (\\(&gt;\\) 50%).\n\nDisadvantages\n\nQuite simplistic — identical to simple substitution if we only have one LOD.\nLess reliable for values near and below the LOD.\nThe mean tends to be overestimated — need to rely on median.\n\n4.1.2.3 Regression on Order Statistics (ROS)\nRegression on Order Statistics is a semi-parametric approach. I.e., it combines elements of parametric and nonparametric models. It follows a two-step approach:\n\nPlot the uncensored values on a probability plot (QQ plot) and use linear regression to approximate the parameters of the underlying data distribution.\nUse this fitted distribution to impute estimates for the censored values.\n\nThere is an assumption that the censored measures are normally (or lognormally) distributed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Example: Bathing water quality (continued)\n\n\n\nThe plot shows the uncensored points and their probability plot regression model. The NADA package in R uses lognormal as default. The plot suggests this is sensible. We then use this fitted model to estimate the values of the censored observations based on their normal quantiles.\n\n\n\n\nWe can compare our ROS approach to simple substitution for the bathing water example used earlier. The left panel (ROS) shows no trend present, the right panel (simple) has an artificial trend.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvantages\n\nCan be applied to a wide variety of environmental datasets.\nWorks with multiple LODs, but still not too simplistic with a single LOD.\nCan be used with up to 80% censored datapoints.\n\nDisadvantages\n\nSemiparametric approach — requires a distributional model to be assumed.\nSpecifically requires normality (or lognormality) for estimation of parameters.\nTwo-stage model introduces extra source of variability."

    "section": "\n4.2 Outliers",
    "text": "4.2 Outliers\nAn outlier is an extreme or unusual observation in our dataset. These will often (but not always) have a large influence on the outcomes of our analysis. We have to find ways to identify and deal with outliers.\nThere are two main categories of outlier: (1) genuine but extreme values, and (2) data errors. If we have a genuinely extreme value, we should try to accommodate these in our analysis. Not doing so would mean that we are ignoring a real feature of our data. There are robust modelling techniques that allow us to incorporate outliers. On the other hand, if we have an outlier due to data error, we can either try to correct it (where possible) or remove it, since this does not reflect a real observation.\n\n4.2.1 Identifying outliers\nAn outlier is an observation that does not follow the general trend of the rest of the data. It is often helpful to plot your data, since outliers are sometimes very obvious in boxplots or scatterplots or even maps! E.g., Figure 3 shows an Elk’s animal track with two unusual observations. To assess whether these are errors from the tracking device or genuine unusual movement patterns (e.g., escaping a predator), we could compute the velocity between points. This is done using the time stamp and the step length (the straight-line distance traveled). We can then assess how likely it is for the animal to have moved at that calculated speed.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Elk tracking data in southwestern Alberta. The Blue line indicates the tracking for one individual with blue and red crosses showing the start and end point of the track respectively.\n\n\nGraphical techniques are a commonly used for detecting outliers, but sometimes identifying outliers visually is not straightforward and can become difficult with larger data sets. This has led to the development of a variety of outlier detection techniques. There are also several statistical approaches that can be applied to identify datapoints that are significantly different from the rest. These include (but are not limited to) tests of discordancy, Chauvenet’s criterion, Grubb’s test and Dixon’s test.\n\n4.2.1.1 Test of discordancy\nThis is a hypothesis test, where the null hypothesis is that each datapoint comes from a given data distribution F. We look at the maximum (or minimum) value of our sample, \\(x_{(n)}\\) and test whether it is a reasonable sample from F. If the maximum (or minimum) value could reasonably come from this distribution, we have no outliers. If the maximum (or minimum) value is an outlier, we check the second highest (or lowest) and so on.\n\n4.2.1.2 Chauvenet’s criterion\nThis test assumes that our data are from a Normal distribution. For our dataset of size \\(n\\), we calculate the mean (\\(\\mu\\)) and standard deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)). We then use the Normal probability density function to estimate the probability (\\(p\\)) of obtaining a value as extreme our more extreme than or suspected outlier. If \\(p \\times n &lt; 0.5\\), then our value is considered to be an outlier.\n\n4.2.1.3 Grubbs’ test\nAgain, this test assumes that our data are from an N(\\(\\mu, \\sigma^2\\)) distribution. The Grubbs’ test statistic is the largest absolute deviation from this mean in terms of units of the standard deviation: \\[G = \\frac{\\max\\limits_{i=1,\\ldots,n} |y_i - \\mu|}{\\sigma}.\\] This is compared to the \\(t(N-2)\\) distribution to obtain a p-value. If we identify an outlier, we repeat the process for the next most extreme value.\n\n4.2.1.4 Dixon’s test\nRather than looking at the dataset as a whole, Dixon’s test compares the outlier to the next most extreme value. Let the gap be the distance between our suspected outlier and the closest value, and the range be the full range of the dataset. Then we compare \\(Q = \\frac{\\mbox{gap}}{\\mbox{range}}\\) to a specifically designed reference table.\nThis test is only suitable if there is a single distinct suspected outlier. If there were two similar outliers, then the gap would not be large.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Example: Effectiveness of mosquito sprays\n\n\n\nThe example dataset below shows the effectiveness of several mosquito sprays.\n\n\n\n\nThe outliers package in R contains functions for Grubbs’ and Dixon’s tests. Here we apply the Grubbs’ test to the insect spray data.\n\nCodegrubbs.test(InsectSprays$count)\n\n\nGrubbs test for one outlier\n\ndata:  InsectSprays$count\nG = 2.29062, U = 0.92506, p-value = 0.719\nalternative hypothesis: highest value 26 is an outlier\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Exercise 10\n\n\n\nWhat conclusion can we draw from the results of the above test?\n\nThere is no statistically significant evidence that the point with the highest value is an outlier\nThere is statistically significant evidence that the point with the highest value is an outlier\n\n\nSolution\n\nSince the p-value for the Grubbs’ test is greater than 0.05, we can conclude that there is no statistically significant evidence that the point with the highest value is an outlier.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Example: Effectiveness of mosquito sprays (continued)\n\n\n\nWe can also apply the Grubbs’ test to the data for just one spray type (spray C).\n\nCodegrubbs.test(InsectSprays$count[InsectSprays$spray==\"C\"])\n\n\nG = 2.48917, U = 0.38553, p-value = 0.0153\nalternative hypothesis: highest value 7 is an outlier\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Exercise 11\n\n\n\nWhat conclusion can we draw from the results of the above test?\n\nThere is no statistically significant evidence that the point with the highest value is an outlier\nThere is statistically significant evidence that the point with the highest value is an outlier\n\n\nSolution\n\nSince the p-value for the Grubbs’ test is less than 0.05, we can conclude that there is statistically significant evidence that the point with the highest value is an outlier.\nThis is unsurprising from the plot, as since the point is drawn as a circle above the upper whisker of the boxplot, we see that R has identified this point as being more than 1.5 times the interquartile range above the upper quartile. Note, however, that this does not necessarily mean that this point is an outlier, so that a test was still required.\n\n\n\n\n4.2.2 Dealing with outliers\nWe generally do not want to discard outliers. Sometimes, we can fit a model with and without them to assess their impact on the results. Additionally, we can use robust alternatives to summary statistics, for example median instead of mean, and median absolute deviation (MAD) instead of standard deviation.\nThe median absolute deviation is defined as: \\[\\mbox{MAD} = \\mbox{median}|y_i - \\tilde{y}|\\] where \\(\\tilde{y}\\) is the median of our dataset. In other words, we find all the distances between our points and the median, and then take the median of those distances."

    "section": "\n4.3 Missing Data",
    "text": "4.3 Missing Data\nEnvironmental data are very prone to missing values. There is a whole discipline of statistics related to this, and we will just touch on the topic.\nData can be missing for any number of reasons. Adverse weather (e.g., rainfall, snow, drought or wind) can affect measuring equipment or prevent access to the location. We can have missing data due to the failure of scientific equipment or samples being lost or damaged. Monitoring networks also often change in size over time, with data considered “missing” at a certain site before that site was introduced or after it was removed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Exercise 12\n\n\n\nWhat causes of missing data do each of the three examples in the images below illustrate? Are these data missing at random?\n\n\n\n\n\nTop image: MERIS data over Ireland.\n\n\nSolution\n\nCloud cover means that the satellite cannot observe the lakes, oceans or land. These data are not missing at random, since cloud cover is likely to change over the seasons.\n\n\nMiddle images: MODIS data over the Aral Sea, for two timepoints.\n\n\nSolution\n\nThe Aral Sea has decreased in size over the years, due to human impacts. Suppose that we wish to measure chlorophyll levels in a certain location in the lake. The changing size of the lake means that some locations that had data in previous years will have missing data (since there is no water present at that location) in more recent years. The data are therefore not missing at random.\n\n\nBottom image: MODIS data over Lake Superior.\n\n\nSolution\n\nIce cover means that the satellite cannot observe the lake water. These data are not missing at random, since ice cover occurs during the coldest times of the year. This may be problematic, if it occurs during peaks or troughs of patterns of the variable that we wish to measure (e.g., chlorophyll may reach its lowest values at the same time that ice cover appears and prevents the satellite from recording measurements).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe technique we use to deal with missing data depends on the type of missingness. If there are a handful of datapoints missing at random, we can essentially ignore this and carry out our analysis as usual. However, if they are missing in some sort of systematic way (e.g., a whole month missing due to bad weather), we may instead look at some form of imputation.\n\n4.3.1 Imputation\nImputation is a process which involves predicting the missing values via some form of statistical method. There are two main forms of imputation:\n\n\nSingle imputation involves generating one value in place of each missing value.\n\nMultiple imputation involves generating several values in place of each missing value.\n\nSingle imputation has the advantage of being simpler, allowing for a straightforward analysis once the missing values have been estimated. Multiple imputation does a better job of accounting for the uncertainty of the imputation process, but it makes the final analysis more complex.\nOur approach for generating the imputed value will vary depending on the context. In the simplest case, we may replace missing values with the overall mean — usually only if we have very limited information. More commonly, we may use neighbouring values, or some form of seasonal mean. These will usually work reasonably well as long as we do not have too many missing data. A more complex approach is to fit a more general statistical model, perhaps taking account of other variables and/or using random components.\nTo handle missing data, models that incorporate it should be chosen over simply ignoring the missing values. If the missing data can be predicted based on the observed data, imputation models can effectively estimate them."

    "text": "In this section we recap some important statistical properties of our estimators (for further details please refer to the statistical inference course).\nA population parameter \\(\\theta\\) represents a quantitative measurement of population values. Since \\(\\theta\\) is typically unknown, we need to estimate it by drawing samples from the population of interest. Our estimator, \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\),is then computed based on the samples we have obtained. The question is then, how well does \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) do its job in estimating \\(\\theta\\)? To evaluate this, we examine key statistical properties of estimators.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Sampling from Normal Distribution. The black curve represent the true population distribution with mean represented by the black solid line. The colored point are two different samples with their corresponding sample mean shown in colured dashed lines.\n\n\n\n\nConsistency\nAs we see in Figure 1, there is some discrepancy between the sample means and the true population mean. Thus, it is expected that, as the sample size increases, our estimator \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) will get closer to the true value \\(\\theta\\). Thus an estimator \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) is said to be consistent if it converges to the true parameter \\(\\theta\\) as the sample size \\(n\\) increases, i.e., \\(\\hat{\\theta} \\rightarrow \\theta\\) as \\(n\\to\\infty\\). E.g., let \\(\\hat{\\theta} = \\bar{x} + \\frac{1}{n}\\) be a biased but consistent estimator of \\(\\theta = 5\\) (\\(\\bar{x}\\) represents the sample mean). Figure 2 shows how as sample size increases, the estimator converges to the true parameter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Demonstration of estimator consistency. The dashed red line indicates the true parameter value. The blue line tracks the mean estimate across increasing sample sizes, while the shaded region represents the 95% confidence interval.\n\n\n\n\nExpected value\nThe expected value of an estimator is a weighted average of all possible estimates. Here, the weights are given by the probability of selecting a particular sample \\(s\\), i.e., \\(p(s)\\). Mathematically, this can be written as:\n\\[\n\\mathbb{E}(\\hat{\\theta})= \\sum_{x\\in\\Omega} p(s)\\hat{\\theta(s)}\n\\]\nWhere \\(\\Omega\\) is the sample space, i.e. the number of possible samples. Furthermore, if all possible samples are equally likely then \\(p(s)=\\frac{1}{\\Omega}\\) and the expected values becomes:\n\\[\n\\mathbb{E}(\\hat{\\theta}) = \\dfrac{1}{\\Omega} \\sum_{s\\in\\Omega} \\hat{\\theta}(s).\n\\]\nNote that the expected value is a function of both, the sampling design (due to \\(p(s)\\)) and the population being sampled (through the sample estimate \\(\\hat{\\theta}(s)\\)).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Task 1\n\n\n\nSuppose we have a tiny population of three trees with the following diameters (cm) :\n\n\nTree\ndiameter (cm)\n\n\n\n1\n9.1\n\n\n2\n10.2\n\n\n3\n17.2\n\n\n\nNow, we sample only 2 trees and measure the diameter of each tree in the sample. It is clear from here that there are only \\(\\Omega=3\\) possible samples we could’ve taken:\n\n\\(s_1 = \\{\\text{tree 1},\\text{tree 2}\\}\\)\n\\(s_2 = \\{\\text{tree 1},\\text{tree 3}\\}\\)\n\\(s_3 = \\{\\text{tree 2},\\text{tree 3}\\}\\)\n\nImagine that samples are selected with an equal probability so that \\(p(s_1) = p(s_2) = p(s_3) = 1/3\\).\nThe true population mean diameter is \\(\\mu_y = ( 9.1+10.2+ 17.2)/3 =12.17\\).\nSuppose we chose the sample average \\(\\bar{y}\\) as our estimate of \\(\\mu_y\\). Then, the expected value of \\(\\bar{y}\\) is given by\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\\mathbb{E}(\\bar{y}) &= p(s_1) \\left(\\dfrac{9.1+10.2}{2}\\right) +  p(s_2) \\left(\\dfrac{9.1+17.2}{2}\\right) +  p(s_3) \\left(\\dfrac{10.2+17.2}{2}\\right)\\\\&= \\dfrac{1}{3}\\left(\\dfrac{19.3}{2} + \\dfrac{26.3}{2} + \\dfrac{27.4}{2} \\right)\\\\&= 12.17 = \\mu_y\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nWhat would have happened if our sampling design had unequal sampling probabilities given by \\(p(s_1) = 1/2\\), \\(p(s_2) = 1/3\\) and \\(p(s_3) = 1/6\\)? Calculate \\(\\mathbb{E}(\\hat{y})\\) under this sampling scenario.\n\n\nSee Solution\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbb{E}(\\bar{y}) &= p(s_1) \\left(\\dfrac{9.1+10.2}{2}\\right) +  p(s_2) \\left(\\dfrac{9.1+17.2}{2}\\right) +  p(s_3) \\left(\\dfrac{10.2+17.2}{2}\\right)\\\\\n&= \\dfrac{1}{2}\\left(\\dfrac{19.3}{2} \\right) + \\frac{1}{3} \\left(\\dfrac{26.3}{2}\\right) + \\dfrac{1}{6}\\left(\\dfrac{27.4}{2} \\right)\\\\\n&= \\dfrac{19.3}{4}  + \\dfrac{26.3}{6} + \\dfrac{27.4}{12} \\\\\n&= 11.5 \\neq \\mu_y\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\n\nIn practice, \\(\\mathbb{E}(\\hat{\\theta})\\) cannot be evaluated because we can not measure all the \\(N\\) elements of our population of interest! (and if we could then \\(\\theta\\) could be evaluated directly on our population rather than obtaining a samples from it). However, understanding this concept is important for two other relevant quantities.\nBias\nThe bias of an estimator is the difference in magnitude between its expected value and the population parameter for which an estimated is desired:\n\\[\n\\textbf{Bias}(\\hat{\\theta}) = \\mathbb{E}(\\hat{\\theta}) - \\theta\n\\]\nWhen \\(\\mathbb{E}(\\hat{\\theta}) = \\theta\\) , \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) is said to be an unbiased estimator of \\(\\theta\\).\nNote that the bias is not a property of an individual estimate (e.g., \\(\\hat{\\theta}(s)\\)). E.g., we can see in Figure 1 there are some discrepancies between the true population parameter \\(\\theta\\) and the sample estimates \\(\\hat{\\theta}(1)\\) and \\(\\hat{\\theta}(2)\\). Such discrepancies \\(\\hat{\\theta}(s) - \\theta\\) are known as sampling errors. This doesn’t mean that an error has been made during the sampling, it just indicates that the value being estimated will differ from the true value because is being estimated from just a fraction of the elements of the population. Thus, one may wonder how much an estimate \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) from one sample will differ from that calculated from a different sample. In principle we would like this difference to be small because that will ensure that no matter which sample we take, the estimated value will be similar across samples.\nVariance\nThe variance of an estimator or sampling variance is the average squared distance between individual estimates \\(\\hat{\\theta}(s)\\) and their expected value \\(\\mathbb{E}(\\hat{\\theta})\\), i.e.,\n\\[\n\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\theta}) = \\sum_{s\\in \\Omega} p(s) \\left(\\hat{\\theta}(s)-\\mathbb{E}(\\hat{\\theta})\\right)^2\n\\] Notice how the variance of an estimator does not depend (unlike the bias) on the true parameter \\(\\theta\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Task 2\n\n\n\nUsing the data from the previous task and assuming equal sampling probabilities, calculate \\(\\text{Var}(\\hat{y})\\)\n\n\nSee Solution\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{Var}(\\bar{y}) &= p(s_1) \\left(\\dfrac{19.3}{2} - 12.17\\right)^2 +  p(s_2) \\left(\\dfrac{26.3}{2} - 12.17\\right)^2 +  p(s_3) \\left(\\dfrac{27.4}{2} - 12.17\\right)^2\\\\\n&= \\dfrac{1}{3}\\left(  9.65 \\right) =  3.22\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\n\nPrecision\nThe precision of an estimator is a qualitative measurement that assess how small or large the variability of an estimator is and does not relate to the true value. To illustrate this, suppose we draw 20 random samples with equal probability from our population of interest . Figure 3 shows 100 replicates/data sets of this experiment with 4 different estimators:\n\n\\(\\hat{\\theta}_{1}(s) =\\frac{1}{20}\\sum_{i=1}^{20} x_i\\) - the mean of the \\(s\\)th sample which is unbiased and precise\n\\(\\hat{\\theta}_{2}(s) = \\text{arg min } (x_1,\\ldots, x_{20})\\) - the \\(s\\)th sample minimum value which is biased and imprecise.\n\\(\\hat{\\theta}_{3}(s)  = x_1\\) - the first observation of the unordered sample which is unbiased and imprecise.\n\\(\\hat{\\theta}_{4}(s) =2 + \\frac{1}{20}\\sum_{i=1}^{20} x_i\\) - the mean + constant which is biased but precise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Illustration of bias and precision of an estimator. The red dashed line shows the true population parameter. the grey point shows the sample of the j-th data set, and the colored points indicate the estimates for each sample.\n\n\nImagine a dartboard where the bullseye represents the true population parameter (\\(\\theta\\)). Each throw corresponds to a sample estimate (\\(\\hat{\\theta}(s)\\)). Precision refers to how tightly clustered the darts are - a precise estimator produces estimates that land close together, regardless of their position relative to the bullseye. Bias, on the other hand, is the systematic offset from the bullseye - even with perfect precision, a biased estimator would consistently miss the center in the same direction."
