Read the paper (available below), summarise the different methods compared by the authors and comment on what the conclusions were.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{{< downloadthis EastoeCensoredData.pdf dname=\"EastoeCensoredData\" label=\"Download Eastoe et al. paper\" icon=\"database-fill-down\" type=\"info\" >}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Task 2 {.unnumbered}\n\nThe Shannon index (or Shannon-Wiener diversity index) is widely used in Ecology to quantify the diversity of a biological community by considering both species richness and evenness. It is calculated as:\n\n$$\nH = -\\sum_{i=1}^S p_i \\log (p_i)\n$$\n\nwhere $p_i$ is the proportion of species $i$ in the community computed as the ratio between the num. of individuals of a given species $n_i$ and total number of individual across all species $N$.\n\n1.  Suppose a fixed number of individuals $N$ are sampled and that the proportion of each species is estimated with some uncertainty $u(p_i)$. Provide the general form for the uncertainty propagation of these proportions on the calculation of $H$.\n\n2.  Imagine you go to your garden an find out there are $S=3$ different species of arthropods living there. Then you go out one day and sample $N=100$ individuals and end up collecting $n_1 = 50 \\text{ ants}$, $n_2 = 30 \\text{ beetles}$ and $n_3 = 20 \\text{ spiders}$. Assuming that number of individuals of a given species follows $n_i \\sim \\text{Binomial}(N,\\theta_i)$, and let $\\hat{\\theta_i} = \\frac{n_i}{N} = p_i$ be the estimator of $\\theta_i$ show that $u(p_i)^2 = p_i(1-p_i)/N$ and then compute the uncertainty propagation for the Shannon Index.\n\n## Task 3 {.unnumbered}\n\nWaves have a major influence on the marine environment and ultimately on the planet's climate and so are often studied by oceanographers. The period of a particular wave oscillation is measured to be $T=(2\\pm0.1)s$. What is the uncertainty associated with the frequency, $f$, of the wave, where $f=1/T$?\n\n## Task 4 {.unnumbered}\n\n10 sets of data (N=13) have been collected. Within each there is a number of (suspected) outliers.\n\n```         \n     mean median    sd   MAD Nout?\ns1  23.82  10.31 33.21 13.98     2\ns2  17.72  10.90 24.88  7.64     1\ns3  16.58   9.83 25.05  7.52     1\ns4  24.13  10.63 33.56 14.13     2\ns5  30.68  10.24 39.37 21.07     3\ns6  30.82  10.64 39.04 21.08     3\ns7  23.79  10.01 33.91 14.47     2\ns8  23.95  10.05 34.01 14.39     2\ns9  30.96  10.50 39.40 21.33     3\ns10 24.31  10.52 33.79 14.32     2\n```\n\nThe data for the first sample are shown below:\n\n```         \n9.89, 10.55, 9.67, 10.62, 10.31, 10.21, 10.92, 98.25, 99.03, 9.33, 11.17, 9.78, 9.90\n```\n\nThe R code/output below shows the results of various outlier tests. Comment on this output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Chauvenet’s test for outliers\n\nP <- 1-pnorm(s1[9],mean(s1), sd(s1))\nP*length(s1)\n[1] 0.152972\n\n# Grubbs test for one outlier\n\ndata:  s1\nG = 2.2647, U = 0.5370, p-value = 0.06811\nalternative hypothesis: highest value 99.03 is an outlier\n\n# Dixon test for outliers\n\ndata:  s1\nQ = 0.98321, p-value < 2.2e-16\nalternative hypothesis: highest value 99.03 is an outlier\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Task 5 {.unnumbered}\n\n(a) An ecologist wishes to analyse a dataset that contains a variable with around 1% of its data censored at a limit of detection. The ecologist proposes to use a simple substitution method to replace all values at the limit of detection ($c_L$) with 0.5$c_L$. Do you agree with this approach? Why/ why not?\n\n(b) The ecologist wishes to analyse another dataset that contains a variable with around 55% of the data censored at a limit of detection. The ecologist would like to take the same simple substitution approach as in part (a). Do you agree with this approach? What advice would you give?\n\n## Task 6 {.unnumbered}\n\n(a) Suppose that chlorophyll data in a freshwater loch are collected twice a week, but the equipment needs to be removed for maintenance once a month, so that there are around 12 missing values per year. Can we assume that these values are missing at random?\n\n(b) Suppose that in another loch, the data are also collected twice a week, but the monitoring device there only needs to be maintained once a year. If this is removed every December, so that there are no values for that month, can we assume that these data are missing at random? Might we need to impute the data?\n\n# Part B: Sampling and monitoring\n\n::: callout-note\nThis part of the tutorial sheet relates to material in Week 3, which we'll cover in the lectures during the same week as Tutorial 1. You can attempt these questions in Tutorial 1 if you wish, but you may prefer to go through these during Tutorial 2 instead.\n:::\n\n## Task 7 {.unnumbered}\n\nIn the case of a simple random sample $x_1,..., x_n$ of a random variable, $X$, assuming the observations are independent,\n\n(a) derive the expected value of $X^2$\n(b) derive the expected value of $\\bar{X}^2$\n(c) show that the sample variance, $s^2$, is an unbiased estimator of the population variance, $\\sigma^2$.\n\n## Task 8 {.unnumbered}\n\n[Gilbert (1977)](https://go.exlibris.link/DnZPRrww) reports results of soil sampling at a nuclear weapons test area obtained using stratified random sampling to assess the total amount of Plutonium found in surface soil. Use the information in the table below to:\n\n(a) Estimate the total inventory and derive the estimator for the variance of the totals\n\n(b) Determine the optimal number of population units of measure in each of the 4 strata. Find the total number of units to sample, assuming cost is fixed (where total=£50,000 and cost per unit is £500 for all strata).\n\n| strata | Size $\\times$ area of the stratum $N_l$ | $n_l$ | Mean for stratum | Variance $s^2_l$ |\n|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n| 1 | 351,000 | 18 | 4.1 | 30.42 |\n| 2 | 82,300 | 12 | 73 | 10,800 |\n| 3 | 26,200 | 13 | 270 | 127,413 |\n| 4 | 11,000 | 20 | 260 | 84,500 |\n\n:::{.callout-tip}\n\nThe stratified estimator of the population total is\n\n$$\n\\hat{I} = \\sum_{l=1}^{L} N_l \\, \\bar{y}_l .\n$$\nYou may use the fact that the variance for the mean of $l$-th strata is given by \n\n$$\n\\text{Var}(\\bar{y}_l)= \\left( 1 - \\frac{n_l}{N_l} \\right)\\frac{s_l^2}{n_l}\n$$\n\n:::\n\n## Task 9 {.unnumbered}\n\nDiscuss the advantages and disadvantages of the three sampling methods below for mapping a pollutant field:\n\n-   Simple random sampling\n-   Systematic sampling\n-   Stratified random sampling\n\n## Task 10 {.unnumbered}\n\nThe Water Framework Directive states:\n\n*\"Member states must ensure that enough individual water bodies of each water type are monitored and determine how many stations are required to determine the ecological and chemical status of the water body\"*\n\nDiscuss briefly how you would translate this statement into a monitoring programme, given that there are 6 different water body types comprising 10%, 25%, 30%, 20%, 10% and 5% of the total population of 6600 water bodies and that your limited resources only allow you to study a total of 200 water bodies. Knowledge of the within-type variability is not available.\n\n## Task 11 {.unnumbered}\n\nRead pages 17--23 of the Analytical Laboratories for the Measurement of Environmental Radioactivity (ALMERA) report on soil sampling (available [on Moodle](https://moodle.gla.ac.uk/pluginfile.php/9627009/mod_folder/content/0/ALMERA%20Soil%20Sampling%20Tutorial%20Sheet%201.pdf)). Describe briefly the sampling strategy adopted and also the methods of analysis presented.\n\n## Task 12 {.unnumbered}\n\nRead the SEPA survey of business waste (available [on Moodle](https://moodle.gla.ac.uk/pluginfile.php/9627009/mod_folder/content/0/SEPA%20Sampling%20Tutorial%20Sheet%201.docx)) and describe briefly the sampling strategy you would propose.
