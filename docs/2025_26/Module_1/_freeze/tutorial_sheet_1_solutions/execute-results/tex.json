Read the paper (available below), summarise the different methods compared by the authors and comment on what the conclusions were.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{{< downloadthis EastoeCensoredData.pdf dname=\"EastoeCensoredData\" label=\"Download Eastoe et al. paper\" icon=\"database-fill-down\" type=\"info\" >}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class='webex-solution'><button>Solution</button>\n\n\n(a) Replacement analysis; replace values marked at the LOD by 2/3 of that value. Rationale is that true value will be somewhere between zero and the LOD. After replacing the censored values, the distribution of the data are assumed to be log normally distributed and the likelihood function is maximized in order to obtain parameter estimates. Replacement analysis is a standard approach that is commonly used in practice. We will call the model fitted with parameters estimated with this approach Model R.\n\n(b) Survival analysis; In this case a parametric distribution is specified – in this case – again log normal distribution was assumed. The likelihood function is then made up of the product of the density functions for the observed values and the probabilities of getting a censored value. The likelihood is then maximized to estimate the parameters of the distribution - all the data were used within this (both observations marked at the LOD and those without). We will call the model fitted with parameters estimated with this approach Model S.\n\nFor each of the approaches a Kaplan Meier estimator was computed in order to explore the survival function of the standardized residuals from models R and S. This was done to assess goodness of fit (and to see if the assumed distribution was normal).\n\n**Conclusions:** LOD values cannot be ignored! The estimated survival functions showed the models fitted the data well and the distributional assumptions were satisfied – particularly for model S. When the proportion of LOD values was low (\\<10%) there was little difference between the approaches. With a greater proportion of censored observations survival analysis models were more robust in terms of estimating a trend.\n\n\n</div>\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-tip icon=\"false\"}\n## {{< bi question-octagon color=#6dc83c >}} Task 2\n\nThe Shannon index (or Shannon-Wiener diversity index) is widely used in Ecology to quantify the diversity of a biological community by considering both species richness and evenness. It is calculated as:\n\n$$\nH = -\\sum_{i=1}^S p_i \\log (p_i)\n$$\n\nwhere $p_i$ is the proportion of species $i$ in the community computed as the ratio between the num. of individuals of a given species $n_i$ and total number of individual across all species $N$.\n\n1.  Suppose a fixed number of individuals $N$ are sampled and that the proportion of each species is estimated with some uncertainty $u(p_i)$. Provide the general form for the uncertainty propagation of these proportions on the calculation of $H$.\n\n2.  Imagine you go to your garden an find out there are $S=3$ different species of arthropods living there.

The medians are all close to 10, indicating that this is likely close of the mean of the data if it was not influenced by large/outlier values. We could not confirm this without observing all data, however.\n\nThe median absolute difference provides a more robust estimate of the spread of the data if outliers are present. The MAD values are all much lower than the variance estimates provided. The greater the number of suspected outliers, the higher the MAD.\n\nIn terms of the sample data, there are two values which are much larger than the others (observations 8 and 9). We would need to go back to how the data has been collected and recorded before we assess whether or not these are truly ‘outliers’ but they may be identified as such using the statistical test results presented.\n\n**Chauvenet’s Criterion**\n\nThis is assessing if observation 9 can be termed an ‘outlier’. As the value of P multiplied by n (=13) is less than 0.5 (0.15) this indicates there is evidence that observation 9 is an outlier by Chauvenet’s criterion.\n\n**Grubbs Test**\n\nHere we are testing the null hypothesis that the maximum value is not an outlier against the alternative that it is an outlier. As the p value is 0.06 it is just above the significance level of 0.05 (5%) and so the maximum is not deemed to be an outlier using this test. The output for the test with the second highest value is presented below – in this case the highest value is deemed to be an outlier.

As the p value is \\<0.05 it is much less than the significance level of 0.05 (5%).

We have the strata identified as well as their relative proportions within the population. We have been told that we can ‘afford’ to have a sample size of $n=200$. As there is no information regarding within-type variability available we cannot use Neyman allocation. The simplest approach is to use proportional allocation where the allocation of samples to the stratum is pro-rata to the size of the stratum within the population.\n\nSo, for population discussed we have:\n\n-   Population size ($N$) 6600\n-   Sample size $n =200$\n\n| $W_l$ | $N_l = W_lN$             | Proportional allocation $nW_l$ |\n|-------|--------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| 0.10  | $0.10 \\times 6600 = 660$ | $200 \\times 0.10 = 20$         |\n| 0.25  | 1650                     | 50                             |\n| 0.30  | 1980                     | 60                             |\n| 0.20  | 1320                     | 40                             |\n| 0.10  | 660                      | 20                             |\n| 0.05  | 330                      | 10                             |\n\n\n</div>\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-tip icon=\"false\"}\n## {{< bi question-octagon color=#6dc83c >}} Task 11\n\nRead pages 17--23 of the Analytical Laboratories for the Measurement of Environmental Radioactivity (ALMERA) report on soil sampling (available below).

From each sub areas a systematic sample was collected, with samples 2m apart (25 per sub area). The 25 samples per sub-area were pooled to give 100 composite samples. These composite samples were used to look at long range variability.\n\nFor two sub areas (cells) each of the 25 samples/cell were analysed separately in order to verify within cell variability. There is no explanation given as to how these two sub areas were selected.\n\nThe sampling approach used is fundamentally systematic. The sample preparation and analytical activity were performed by a single laboratory in order to rule out the variabilities due to different analytical laboratories.\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.callout-tip icon=\"false\"}\n## {{< bi question-octagon color=#6dc83c >}} Task 12\n\nRead the SEPA survey of business waste (available [on Moodle](https://moodle.gla.ac.uk/pluginfile.php/9627009/mod_folder/content/0/SEPA%20Sampling%20Tutorial%20Sheet%201.docx)) and describe briefly the sampling strategy you would propose.

Therefore, a natural approach may be to apply a stratified sampling plan.\n\nThe advantage of this approach is that the estimates we get would be more precise than if a simple random sampling approach was used and hence this is a more efficient approach.\n\nHowever, there are potential disadvantages. One of which is to use a proportional sampling scheme we need to have knowledge about the relative sizes of the different strata in the population. An additional potential disadvantage is that there may be some strata where there are very small numbers of firms, and so there are possible issues surrounding information disclosure or identifiability and the entire population of the strata is sampled.\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n:::",
