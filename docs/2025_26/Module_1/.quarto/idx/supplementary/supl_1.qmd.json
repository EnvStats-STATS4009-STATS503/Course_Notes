Since $\\theta$ is typically unknown, we need to estimate it by drawing samples from the population of interest. Our estimator, $\\hat{\\theta}$,is then computed based on the samples we have obtained. The question is then, how well does $\\hat{\\theta}$ do its job in estimating $\\theta$? To evaluate this, we examine key statistical properties of estimators.\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n#| message: false\n#| warning: false\n#| fig-width: 6\n#| fig-height: 5\n#| fig-align: center\n#| fig-cap: \"Sampling from Normal Distribution.

Thus, it is expected that, as the sample size increases, our estimator $\\hat{\\theta}$ will get closer to the true value $\\theta$. Thus an estimator $\\hat{\\theta}$ is said to be *consistent* if it converges to the true parameter $\\theta$ as the sample size $n$ increases, i.e., $\\hat{\\theta} \\rightarrow \\theta$ as $n\\to\\infty$. E.g., let $\\hat{\\theta} = \\bar{x} + \\frac{1}{n}$ be a biased but consistent estimator of $\\theta = 5$ ($\\bar{x}$ represents the sample mean). @fig-sampling2 shows how as sample size increases, the estimator converges to the true parameter.\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n#| message: false\n#| warning: false\n#| fig-width: 4\n#| fig-height: 4\n#| fig-align: center\n#| fig-cap: \" Demonstration of estimator consistency.

Mathematically, this can be written as:\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}(\\hat{\\theta})= \\sum_{x\\in\\Omega} p(s)\\hat{\\theta(s)}\n$$\n\nWhere $\\Omega$ is the sample space, i.e. the number of possible samples.

(and if we could then $\\theta$ could be evaluated directly on our population rather than obtaining a samples from it). However, understanding this concept is important for two other relevant quantities.\n\n**Bias**\n\nThe bias of an estimator is the difference in magnitude between its expected value and the population parameter for which an estimated is desired:\n\n$$\n\\textbf{Bias}(\\hat{\\theta}) = \\mathbb{E}(\\hat{\\theta}) - \\theta\n$$\n\nWhen $\\mathbb{E}(\\hat{\\theta}) = \\theta$ , $\\hat{\\theta}$ is said to be an *unbiased estimator* of $\\theta$.\n\nNote that the bias is not a property of an individual estimate (e.g., $\\hat{\\theta}(s)$). E.g., we can see in @fig-sampling1 there are some discrepancies between the true population parameter $\\theta$ and the sample estimates $\\hat{\\theta}(1)$ and $\\hat{\\theta}(2)$. Such discrepancies $\\hat{\\theta}(s) - \\theta$ are known as *sampling errors*. This doesn't mean that an error has been made during the sampling, it just indicates that the value being estimated will differ from the true value because is being estimated from just a fraction of the elements of the population. Thus, one may wonder how much an estimate $\\hat{\\theta}$ from one sample will differ from that calculated from a different sample. In principle we would like this difference to be small because that will ensure that no matter which sample we take, the estimated value will be similar across samples.\n\n**Variance**\n\nThe **variance** of an estimator or *sampling variance* is the average squared distance between individual estimates $\\hat{\\theta}(s)$ and their expected value $\\mathbb{E}(\\hat{\\theta})$, i.e.,\n\n$$\n\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\theta}) = \\sum_{s\\in \\Omega} p(s) \\left(\\hat{\\theta}(s)-\\mathbb{E}(\\hat{\\theta})\\right)^2 \n$$ Notice how the variance of an estimator does not depend (unlike the bias) on the true parameter $\\theta$\n\n::: {.callout-important icon=\"false\"}\n## {{< bi pencil-square color=#c8793c >}} Task 2\n\nUsing the data from the previous task and assuming equal sampling probabilities, calculate $\\text{Var}(\\hat{y})$\n\n`r hide(\"See Solution\")`\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{Var}(\\bar{y}) &= p(s_1) \\left(\\dfrac{19.3}{2} - 12.17\\right)^2 +  p(s_2) \\left(\\dfrac{26.3}{2} - 12.17\\right)^2 +  p(s_3) \\left(\\dfrac{27.4}{2} - 12.17\\right)^2\\\\\n&= \\dfrac{1}{3}\\left(  9.65 \\right) =  3.22 \n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n`r unhide()`\n:::\n\n**Precision**\n\nThe **precision** of an estimator is a qualitative measurement that assess how small or large the variability of an estimator is and does not relate to the true value.

E.g., we can see in @fig-sampling1 there are some discrepancies between the true population parameter $\\theta$ and the sample estimates $\\hat{\\theta}(1)$ and $\\hat{\\theta}(2)$. Such discrepancies $\\hat{\\theta}(s) - \\theta$ are known as *sampling errors*. This doesn't mean that an error has been made during the sampling, it just indicates that the value being estimated will differ from the true value because is being estimated from just a fraction of the elements of the population. Thus, one may wonder how much an estimate $\\hat{\\theta}$ from one sample will differ from that calculated from a different sample. In principle we would like this difference to be small because that will ensure that no matter which sample we take, the estimated value will be similar across samples.\n\n**Variance**\n\nThe **variance** of an estimator or *sampling variance* is the average squared distance between individual estimates $\\hat{\\theta}(s)$ and their expected value $\\mathbb{E}(\\hat{\\theta})$, i.e.,\n\n$$\n\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\theta}) = \\sum_{s\\in \\Omega} p(s) \\left(\\hat{\\theta}(s)-\\mathbb{E}(\\hat{\\theta})\\right)^2 \n$$ Notice how the variance of an estimator does not depend (unlike the bias) on the true parameter $\\theta$\n\n::: {.callout-important icon=\"false\"}\n## {{< bi pencil-square color=#c8793c >}} Task 2\n\nUsing the data from the previous task and assuming equal sampling probabilities, calculate $\\text{Var}(\\hat{y})$\n\n`r hide(\"See Solution\")`\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{Var}(\\bar{y}) &= p(s_1) \\left(\\dfrac{19.3}{2} - 12.17\\right)^2 +  p(s_2) \\left(\\dfrac{26.3}{2} - 12.17\\right)^2 +  p(s_3) \\left(\\dfrac{27.4}{2} - 12.17\\right)^2\\\\\n&= \\dfrac{1}{3}\\left(  9.65 \\right) =  3.22 \n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n`r unhide()`\n:::\n\n**Precision**\n\nThe **precision** of an estimator is a qualitative measurement that assess how small or large the variability of an estimator is and does not relate to the true value. To illustrate this, suppose we draw 20 random samples with equal probability from our population of interest . @fig-bias_prec shows 100 replicates/data sets of this experiment with 4 different estimators:\n\n-   $\\hat{\\theta}_{1}(s) =\\frac{1}{20}\\sum_{i=1}^{20} x_i$ - the mean of the $s$th sample which is **unbiased** and **precise**\n\n-   $\\hat{\\theta}_{2}(s) = \\text{arg min } (x_1,\\ldots, x_{20})$ - the $s$th sample minimum value which is **biased** and **imprecise**.\n\n-   $\\hat{\\theta}_{3}(s)  = x_1$ - the first observation of the unordered sample which is **unbiased** and **imprecise.**\n\n-   $\\hat{\\theta}_{4}(s) =2 + \\frac{1}{20}\\sum_{i=1}^{20} x_i$ - the mean + constant which is **biased** but **precise**.\n\n::: {.content-visible when-format=\"html\"}\n![Illustration of bias and precision of an estimator.

Each throw corresponds to a sample estimate ($\\hat{\\theta}(s)$). Precision refers to how tightly clustered the darts are - a precise estimator produces estimates that land close together, regardless of their position relative to the bullseye. Bias, on the other hand, is the systematic offset from the bullseye - even with perfect precision, a biased estimator would consistently miss the center in the same direction.\n\n![](images/bias_prec2.png){fig-align=\"center\"
