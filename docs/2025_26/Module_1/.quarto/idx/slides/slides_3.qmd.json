Define the study objectives.\n2.  Summarize the environmental context.\n3.  Identify the target population.\n4.  Select an appropriate sampling design.\n5.  Implement and summarize.\n\n## Step 1: Define the study objectives {.smaller}\n\nWe need to define clear and simple objectives for our study.\n\n-   These will typically be properties of our data that we would like to measure\n    -   Characteristics of a variable, e.g. mean, median, variance.\n    -   Temporal or spatial trends of a variable.\n    -   Frequency of events, e.g. number of pollution events, species abundance or occurrence.\n\n::::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"40%\"}\n**Example**:\n\nWhat is the spatial or temporal variability of water quality across a River Surveillance Network (RSN)?\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"60%\"}\n![](figures/EA_OS1.jpg){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"359\"}\n:::\n:::::\n\n## Step 2: Consider the context\n\n-   We have to think about the context of the question we are asking.\n-   This means understanding the nature of our data, which is essential to ensuring we have a **representative** sample.\n-   For example, if we're measuring a river, we need to know about the depth, width and current.\n-   If we are sampling in a forest, we need to know about vegetation and wildlife.\n\n## Step 3: Identify the target population {.smaller}\n\n-   The population is the set of all possible objects that could be sampled.\n    -   All the fish in a lake.\n    -   All oak trees over 5m tall in a particular part of a forest.\n    -   Every river within a particular water network.\n-   sometimes the population is actually what we are trying to measure, e.g. *\"How many red squirrels live in the Cairngorms National Park?\"*\n\n::: callout-note\n## Example: Water quality\n\n**Target population**: [RSN](https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=a0a065da1ab642e69bd1a5e018b4ddf4) 1:250k with over 1.4 million reaches (a discrete segment of a river with relatively uniform characteristics) .\n\n**Characterise environmental conditions** of the target population such as Water Quality Indicators, i.e., we need to define our **response variable**:\n\n-   Macroinvertebrates composition obtained from the [RICT Model 44](https://environment.data.gov.uk/dataset/8d1422b3-c960-4ed9-a324-40eefb0c016e) network (1:50k scale and trimmed to match the RSN network). E.g., **WHPT-ASPT** (*Walley Hawkes Paisley Trigg Average Score Per Taxon*) is a **biological metric** used to evaluate the ecological health of rivers based on the presence and sensitivity of macroinvertebrate (e.g., insects, worms, snails) communities. \n\n-   Orthophosphate $[\\text{PO}_4]^{3-}$ concentrations (mg/L)\n:::\n\n## Step 4: Select a sampling design\n\nThere are a number of sampling designs which are commonly used for environmental data:\n\n-   Simple random sampling.\n-   Stratified random sampling.\n-   Systematic sampling.\n-   Spatial sampling.\n\nWe will discuss some of these in more detail during the course.\n\n## Step 5: Implement and summarise {.smaller}\n\n-   **Data collection** - what information is being collected and how?\n\n    -   {{< fa leaf >}} **Biological elements** - Macrophytes, macroinvertebrates, diatoms.\n\n    -   {{< fa water >}} **River habitat survey** - Physical habitat essential for fish, macrophytes and invertebrate to live.\n\n    -   {{< fa flask >}} **Physico-chemical elements** - Water quality elements like dissolved oxygen, orthrophosphate, nitrogen\n\n    -   {{< fa biohazard >}} **Toxic chemicals** - Harmful (potentially banned) chemicals\n\n    -   {{< fa bugs >}} **Invasive non-native species** - Plants, animals, fungi, or organisms that have been introduced to a new area where they are not native.\n\n    -   {{< fa temperature-high >}} **Physical properties** - Temperature, width, slope, altitude, etc.\n\n## Step 5: Implement and summarise\n\n-   **Implementation** - Deploying the network and measuring the quantities of interest. Some practical challenges include:\n\n    -   {{< fa sun-plant-wilt >}} River is dry\n\n    -   {{< fa route >}} Route issues\n\n    -   {{< fa road-barrier>}} Site is overgrown, fenced or with barbed wire\n\n    -   {{< fa person-hiking>}} {{< fa mountain-sun>}} Steep or high banks\n\n    -   {{< fa file-contract>}} Land owner permission\n\n    -   {{< fa helmet-safety>}} Safety issues.\n\n## Step 5: Implement and summarise\n\n-   Often statisticians will not actually carry out the sampling. We will rely on field experts in many cases.\n\n-   Once we receive the data, it's important to assess the data for censoring, outliers, missingness etc.\n\n-   We can then fit an appropriate statistical model.\n\n-   Finally, we should report our results in clear language, including uncertainty where appropriate.\n\n## Sampling Strategies {.smaller auto-animate=\"true\"}\n\n::::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"40%\"}\n-   We are interested in population parameter(s) $\\theta$ .\n\n-   Typically, the value of $\\theta$ is unknown and it is unfeasible to measure all $N$ elements of the population.\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"60%\"}\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n#| message: false\n#| warning: false\n#| fig-width: 4\n#| fig-height: 4\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(shiny)\nset.seed(123) #

This is known as **sampling variability**.\n-   We can compute this as: $$\\text{Var}(\\bar{y}) = \\frac{s^2}{n}\\left(1 - \\frac{n}{N}\\right).$$\n-   Here, $(1 - \\frac{n}{N})$ is what is known as a **finite population correction** (FPC). This accounts for the proportion of the data which remains unknown.\n\n## Example: Cobalt-60\n\n-   Cobalt-60 is a synthetic radioactive isotope of cobalt produced in nuclear reactors.\n-   We may be interested in estimating how much of this is in the sediment of a river estuary.\n-   This map is colour coded by different sediment types. How might we make use of this information when sampling?\n\n![](figures/Cobalt.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"474\"}\n\n## Stratified Sampling\n\n-   Stratified sampling involves dividing the population into two or more groups (or strata) which have something in common.\n-   Divide the dataset of size $N$ into $L$ non-overlapping strata such that within-strata variability is less than between-strata variability.\n-   We then ensure that each of our strata are represented in our sample, and take this into account\n\n## Proportional allocation {.smaller}\n\nWe then ensure that that each of these strata are represented proportionally within our sample (known as **proportional allocation**.\n\n-   Samples are still taken randomly *within* each stratum.\n\n![](figures/Cobalt2.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"474\"}\n\n## Mean and variance {.smaller}\n\n-   Let $N_1, \\ldots, N_L$ be the populations of our $L$ strata, and $n_1, \\ldots, n_L$ be the number of samples taken from each.\n\n-   It is straightforward to obtain sample means $y_1, \\ldots, y_L$ and sample variances $s_1^2, \\ldots, s_L^2$ for each stratum.\n\n-   Then we compute the overall sample mean as $$\\bar{y} = \\frac{\\sum_{l=1}^L \\left( N_l \\ y_l \\right)}{N}.$$\n\n-   We can also compute the variance of the sample mean as\n\n$$\\text{Var}\\bar{y} = \\sum_{l=1}^L \\left[ \\left(\\frac{N_l}{N}\\right)^2 \\frac{s_l^2}{n_l} \\left(1 - \\frac{n_l}{N_l} \\right) \\right].$$\n\n## Systematic Sampling\n\n-   Systematic sampling is a sampling method which makes use of a natural ordering that exists in data.\n\n-   We wish to take a sample of size $n$ from a population of size $N$, which means every $k = \\frac{N}{n}$ objects are sampled.\n\n-   For systematic sampling, we select our first unit at random, then select every $k$th unit in a systematic way.\n\n-   For example, if we have $N=50$ and $n=5$, then $k=10$.\n\n-   If our first unit is [2]{style=\"color:red;\"}, our sample becomes units [2, 12, 22, 32, 42]{style=\"color:red;\"}\n\n## Systematic Sampling\n\n| Advantages 😁 | Disadvantages 😔 |\n|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| Convenient and quick. | May not be representative. |\n| Well spaced across the study. | Systematic patterns in the data can be overlooked. |\n| Sort of random --- every object has an equal chance of selection. | Extremely deterministic --- estimation of variance particularly difficult. |\n\n## Spatial Sampling\n\n-   Spatial sampling is required when our data have an attribute that is spatially continuous.\n-   For example, if we are measuring water quality in a lake, we may have a three-dimensional coordinate system of *length*, *width* and\n-   In some cases, it is possible to measure at any one of these locations, simple random sampling or stratified sampling can be used.\n-   There are many examples where it is not possible or convenient to do so, in which case some form of systematic sampling may be used.\n\n## Transects\n\n-   Spatial sampling often uses a systematic sampling scheme based on **transects**.\n\n-   A transect is a straight line along which samples are taken.\n\n-   The starting point, geographical orientation and number of samples are chosen as part of the sampling scheme.\n\n-   Samples will then be either taken at random points along the length of the line (*continuous sampling*) or systematically placed points (*systematic sampling*).\n\n## Transects\n\n-   Suppose we need to take samples of water quality on a lake.\n\n-   Our sampling scheme may use multiple transects simultaneously.\n\n![](figures/Transect.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"474\"}\n\n## Distance sampling {.smaller}\n\n::::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"40%\"}\n-   Is a popular method in ecology for estimating **animal abundance**.\n\n-   Data are obtained by measuring the **perpendicular distances** from a **transect** line to detected individuals.\n\n-   The probability of detection decreases with increasing distances via a *parametric function*.\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"60%\"}\n![](figures/distance-animation.gif){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"625\"}\n:::\n:::::\n\n## Quadrats\n\n-   In some cases, we will instead be interested in trying to understand the frequency of a certain species across space.\n-   A **quadrat** is a tool used in ecology and other settings for this purpose.\n-   A series of squares (quadrats) of a fixed size are placed in the habitat of interest, and the species within the quadrats are counted.\n-   The number of quadrats, and their positions and orientations are chosen as part of the sampling scheme.\n\n## Quadrats\n\nThe quadrats shown below were used to study orangutan nests in a region of Borneo.\n\n![](figures/Quadrat.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"474\"}\n\n## Grid Sampling\n\n-   It may often be useful to use a regular grid to make sampling convenient and efficient.\n-   The grid is overlaid on the spatial region, and a fixed number of samples (usually one) is taken from each grid square.\n-   We choose the size of the grid such that the number of squares relates to the number of samples we require.\n-   For example, for a region of size 5km $\\times$ 5km, choosing 1km $\\times$ 1km grid squares would give us 25 squares in total.\n\n## Types of Grid Sampling\n\n-   **Aligned Grid**: we take a sample from the *same* (randomly selected) coordinates within each square.\n-   **Centrally Aligned Grid**: we take a sample from the *central* coordinates of each square.\n-   **Unaligned Grid**: each grid square has a sample taken from *different* randomly selected coordinates.\n-   **Triangular Grid**: this is a modified version of the aligned grid where the points are fixed based on a triangular arrangement.\n\n## Types of Grid Sampling\n\n![](figures/Grids.jpg){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n## Summary of Grids\n\n-   The aligned and centrally aligned grids are convenient but may miss systematic patterns in the data.\n\n-   The unaligned grid avoids this, and combines the advantages of simple random sampling and stratified sampling. However, it can be inefficient for collection.\n\n-   The triangular grid can perform well in specific cases where the spatial correlation structures varies with direction.\n\n## Example: chlorophyll-*a* in Lake Balaton\n\n-   Aim: Estimate the average level of chlorophyll-*a* in Lake Balaton, Hungary.\n\n-   Levels are heavily affected by differences in the levels of nutrients along the length of the lake (known as a \"trophic gradient\").\n\n![](figures/BalatonSound.jpg){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n## Example: chlorophyll-*a* in Lake Balaton {.smaller}\n\n-   The **population** is all possible water samples from the lake, and our **sampling units** are individual water samples.\n-   Stratified random sampling seems appropriate here due to *heterogeneity* in the lake.\n-   We could design transects which cover most regions of the lake.\n\n::::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"40%\"}\n-   However, there may be difficulty accessing all areas by boat.\n-   Also potential issues with the boat itself disrupting the levels.\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"60%\"}\n![](figures/Balaton.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n:::\n:::::\n\n# Sample size\n\n## Sample size\n\n-   A crucial part of sampling is identifying the appropriate sample size for our study.\n-   If the sample is *too small*, it will not be sufficiently representative of the population.\n-   If the sample is *too big*, it will be expensive and time consuming to collect, which may defeat the purpose of using sampling in the first place.\n\n## Power and/or precision\n\n-   It is therefore important that we understand exactly what it is that we want from our sampling process.\n-   We can think about it in terms of two key aspects, **power** and **precision**.\n-   **Precision**: How accurately do I want (or need) to estimate the mean, median, variance etc?\n-   **Power**: How small a difference is it important to detect, and with what degree of certainty?\n\n## Using confidence intervals\n\n-   The general form of a 95% confidence interval for the population mean, $\\mu$ is\n\n$$\\bar{x} \\pm t_{1-\\alpha/2} \\sqrt{\\text{Var}(\\bar{x})}.$$\n\n-   The width of the interval is determined by the estimated standard error, $\\sqrt{\\text{Var}(\\bar{x})}$, and we know the formula for this contains $n$.\n\n-   Therefore, if we know how wide we need our interval to be (i.e. we know the required precision), we can calculate the $n$ required to do that.\n\n## Choosing the sample size\n\n-   Let our maximum required standard error be denoted as $U$. Then we need to compute: $$\n    \\begin{aligned}\n    \\sqrt{\\text{Var}(\\bar{x)}} \\leq U \\\\\n    \\frac{\\sqrt{s^2}}{\\sqrt{n}} \\leq U \\\\\n    \\sqrt{n} \\geq \\frac{\\sqrt{s^2}}{U}\n    \\end{aligned}\n    $$\n\n-   Here, $s^2$ is the **sample** variance.\n\n-   Can anyone see a problem here?\n\n## Choosing the sample size {auto-animate =true}\n\n-   This calculation requires us to use $s^2$, the variance of our sample.\n-   But we don't have the sample yet. The whole point of this exercise is to determine the size of our sample.\n-   So, what can we use instead?\n\n## Choosing the sample size {auto-animate =true}\n\n-   This calculation requires us to use $s^2$, the variance of our sample.\n-   But we don't have the sample yet. The whole point of this exercise is to determine the size of our sample.\n-   So, what can we use instead?\n-   Typically, we will use knowledge from prior studies where available, or will commission a small pilot study.\n\n## Example: PCB in salmon\n\n-   Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) is a carcinogenic pollutant often found in fish.\n-   We wish to estimate the mean PCB level in the salmon in a fish farm, and require a precision level (estimated standard error) of $\\pm 0.1 \\mbox{mg/kg}^2$.\n-   We know from previous studies that the variation of PCB in salmon flesh is $3.19^2$.\n-   How large a sample do we need?\n\n## Example: PCB in salmon\n\n-   We can solve our prior equation as\n\n$$n \\geq \\left(\\frac{s}{u} \\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{3.19}{0.1} \\right)^2 = 1018.$$\n\n-   We have estimated we need a minimum sample size of 1018 to obtain the required precision.\n-   In some cases this may be impractical, in which case we may have to settle for a lower precision.\n\n## Stratified sampling\n\nFor stratified sampling, this process is much more complicated.\n\n-   As well as considering the sample size, we also have to think about how to allocate our samples across the strata.\n-   A common approach is to specify a **cost mode**, where we take into account the different costs of sampling each stratum.\n-   The aim is to minimise the estimated standard error for a given total cost.\n\n## Cost model\n\n-   Let $C$ be the overall cost, let $c_0$ be the fixed overhead costs of the survey and let $c_l$ be the cost per sample in stratum $l$.\n-   Then our cost model is $$C = c_0 + \\sum_{l=1}^L c_l n_l.$$\n-   Typically $C$ is fixed, and the goal is to select the values of $n_l$ which allow us to obtain the best possible estimate.\n\n## Stratum sample sizes\n\n-   Now let $\\omega_l = N_l/N$ be the proportion of the overall population which is found within stratum $l$.\n\n-   Also let $\\sigma_l$ be the standard deviation for the population of stratum $l$.\n\n-   We can then compute the optimum number of samples in each stratum as\n\n$$n_l = n \\ \\frac{\\omega_l \\sigma_l /\\sqrt{c_l}}{\\sum_{k=1}^L \\omega_k \\sigma_k  /\\sqrt{c_k}}$$\n\n## Notes on stratum sample sizes\n\n-   If the costs are the same for all strata, the equation simplifies to what is known as the **Neyman allocation**\n\n$$n_l = n \\ \\frac{\\omega_l \\sigma_l}{\\sum_{k=1}^L \\omega_k \\sigma_k}$$\n\n-   We often calculate $n$ by a similar approach to that described for simple random sampling.\n-   In practice, the *population* standard deviation $\\sigma_l$ is often replaced by the *sample* standard deviation $s_l$.\n\n## Summary\n\n::: incremental\n-   We now know how to determine the correct sample size to use to obtain estimates with the desired precision.\n-   This requires some advance knowledge, e.g. the tolerable level of error, the cost of the experiment, and the expected standard deviation.\n-   However, bear in mind that we have not considered the possibility of missing data in our sample. Losing some data will impact precision.\n-   We've also assumed that all data points are independent. This is not always true for time series or spatial data. We will address this later in the\n:::\n\n# Monitoring Networks\n\n## Monitoring Networks {.smaller}\n\nA **monitoring network** is a set of stations placed across a region of interest to gather information about one or more environmental resource.\n\n::::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"40%\"}\n-   Aim to detect trends and unexpected changes.\n-   Standard sampling is adequate in many cases.\n-   However, the advantage of networks is that they can change over time.\n-   New sites can be added, different variables measured, technology improved.\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"60%\"}\n![](figures/EnvChangeNetwork.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"487\"}\n:::\n:::::\n\n## Example: Countryside Survey\n\n-   The Countryside Survey is a *census* of the natural resources of the UK's countryside.\n\n-   The first full survey was in 1978, and it was taken again at 6--10 year intervals until 2019.\n\n-   Since 2019, it has been funded as a \"rolling\" survey, measuring locations on 5-yearly cycles.\n\n-   The goal is to map changes at various different scales, as well as to understand what is driving those changes.\n\n## Example: Countryside Survey\n\n::::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"40%\"}\n-   **Stratified sampling** of 1km grid squares from across the UK.\n-   Strata chosen based on Institute of Terrestrial Ecology (ITE) land classification and broad habitat.\n-   <https://countrysidesurvey.org.uk/>\n-   How do we select the sites/resources to monitor?\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"60%\"}\n![](figures/SurveySquares.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"323\"}\n:::\n:::::\n\n## Generalised Randomised Tesselation Stratified (GRTS)\n\n**Generalised Randomised Tesselation Stratified**\n\nIs a form of spatially balanced probability sampling scheme\n\n-   Method for sampling an extensive environmental resource introduced by [@stevens2004]\n-   Builds on random, systematic and stratified sampling procedures while ensuring spatial balance.\n-   Used by USEPA and Marine Scotland to design monitoring networks\n\n## Generalised Randomised Tesselation Stratified (GRTS) {.smaller}\n\n:::::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"40%\"}\n1.

(We can't turn back the clock and check what would have happened without the event.)\n\n## Variable of interest\n\n-   However, this challenge is not unique to environmental data. (We face it regularly in statistics.)\n-   Often, we are only interested in the effect of one particular variable, but we have to account for other nuisance variables via regression or other techniques.\n-   We can also sometimes account for other unmeasured variability through random effects.\n-   The key is to acknowledge what you do and don't know, and to account properly for uncertainty.\n\n## Example: Before-After Single Site {.smaller}\n\n-   Assessing impact of intervention with data for one site.

E.g., **WHPT-ASPT** (*Walley Hawkes Paisley Trigg Average Score Per Taxon*) is a **biological metric** used to evaluate the ecological health of rivers based on the presence and sensitivity of macroinvertebrate (e.g., insects, worms, snails) communities. \n\n-   Orthophosphate $[\\text{PO}_4]^{3-}$ concentrations (mg/L)\n:::\n\n## Step 4: Select a sampling design\n\nThere are a number of sampling designs which are commonly used for environmental data:\n\n-   Simple random sampling.\n-   Stratified random sampling.\n-   Systematic sampling.\n-   Spatial sampling.\n\nWe will discuss some of these in more detail during the course.\n\n## Step 5: Implement and summarise {.smaller}\n\n-   **Data collection** - what information is being collected and how?\n\n    -   {{< fa leaf >}} **Biological elements** - Macrophytes, macroinvertebrates, diatoms.\n\n    -   {{< fa water >}} **River habitat survey** - Physical habitat essential for fish, macrophytes and invertebrate to live.\n\n    -   {{< fa flask >}} **Physico-chemical elements** - Water quality elements like dissolved oxygen, orthrophosphate, nitrogen\n\n    -   {{< fa biohazard >}} **Toxic chemicals** - Harmful (potentially banned) chemicals\n\n    -   {{< fa bugs >}} **Invasive non-native species** - Plants, animals, fungi, or organisms that have been introduced to a new area where they are not native.\n\n    -   {{< fa temperature-high >}} **Physical properties** - Temperature, width, slope, altitude, etc.\n\n## Step 5: Implement and summarise\n\n-   **Implementation** - Deploying the network and measuring the quantities of interest. Some practical challenges include:\n\n    -   {{< fa sun-plant-wilt >}} River is dry\n\n    -   {{< fa route >}} Route issues\n\n    -   {{< fa road-barrier>}} Site is overgrown, fenced or with barbed wire\n\n    -   {{< fa person-hiking>}} {{< fa mountain-sun>}} Steep or high banks\n\n    -   {{< fa file-contract>}} Land owner permission\n\n    -   {{< fa helmet-safety>}} Safety issues.\n\n## Step 5: Implement and summarise\n\n-   Often statisticians will not actually carry out the sampling. We will rely on field experts in many cases.\n\n-   Once we receive the data, it's important to assess the data for censoring, outliers, missingness etc.\n\n-   We can then fit an appropriate statistical model.\n\n-   Finally, we should report our results in clear language, including uncertainty where appropriate.\n\n## Sampling Strategies {.smaller auto-animate=\"true\"}\n\n::::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"40%\"}\n-   We are interested in population parameter(s) $\\theta$ .\n\n-   Typically, the value of $\\theta$ is unknown and it is unfeasible to measure all $N$ elements of the population.\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"60%\"}\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n#| message: false\n#| warning: false\n#| fig-width: 4\n#| fig-height: 4\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(shiny)\nset.seed(123) #

This is known as **sampling variability**.\n-   We can compute this as: $$\\text{Var}(\\bar{y}) = \\frac{s^2}{n}\\left(1 - \\frac{n}{N}\\right).$$\n-   Here, $(1 - \\frac{n}{N})$ is what is known as a **finite population correction** (FPC). This accounts for the proportion of the data which remains unknown.\n\n## Example: Cobalt-60\n\n-   Cobalt-60 is a synthetic radioactive isotope of cobalt produced in nuclear reactors.\n-   We may be interested in estimating how much of this is in the sediment of a river estuary.\n-   This map is colour coded by different sediment types. How might we make use of this information when sampling?\n\n![](figures/Cobalt.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"474\"}\n\n## Stratified Sampling\n\n-   Stratified sampling involves dividing the population into two or more groups (or strata) which have something in common.\n-   Divide the dataset of size $N$ into $L$ non-overlapping strata such that within-strata variability is less than between-strata variability.\n-   We then ensure that each of our strata are represented in our sample, and take this into account\n\n## Proportional allocation {.smaller}\n\nWe then ensure that that each of these strata are represented proportionally within our sample (known as **proportional allocation**.\n\n-   Samples are still taken randomly *within* each stratum.\n\n![](figures/Cobalt2.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"474\"}\n\n## Mean and variance {.smaller}\n\n-   Let $N_1, \\ldots, N_L$ be the populations of our $L$ strata, and $n_1, \\ldots, n_L$ be the number of samples taken from each.\n\n-   It is straightforward to obtain sample means $y_1, \\ldots, y_L$ and sample variances $s_1^2, \\ldots, s_L^2$ for each stratum.\n\n-   Then we compute the overall sample mean as $$\\bar{y} = \\frac{\\sum_{l=1}^L \\left( N_l \\ y_l \\right)}{N}.$$\n\n-   We can also compute the variance of the sample mean as\n\n$$\\text{Var}\\bar{y} = \\sum_{l=1}^L \\left[ \\left(\\frac{N_l}{N}\\right)^2 \\frac{s_l^2}{n_l} \\left(1 - \\frac{n_l}{N_l} \\right) \\right].$$\n\n## Systematic Sampling\n\n-   Systematic sampling is a sampling method which makes use of a natural ordering that exists in data.\n\n-   We wish to take a sample of size $n$ from a population of size $N$, which means every $k = \\frac{N}{n}$ objects are sampled.\n\n-   For systematic sampling, we select our first unit at random, then select every $k$th unit in a systematic way.\n\n-   For example, if we have $N=50$ and $n=5$, then $k=10$.\n\n-   If our first unit is [2]{style=\"color:red;\"}, our sample becomes units [2, 12, 22, 32, 42]{style=\"color:red;\"}\n\n## Systematic Sampling\n\n| Advantages 😁 | Disadvantages 😔 |\n|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| Convenient and quick. | May not be representative. |\n| Well spaced across the study. | Systematic patterns in the data can be overlooked. |\n| Sort of random --- every object has an equal chance of selection. | Extremely deterministic --- estimation of variance particularly difficult. |\n\n## Spatial Sampling\n\n-   Spatial sampling is required when our data have an attribute that is spatially continuous.\n-   For example, if we are measuring water quality in a lake, we may have a three-dimensional coordinate system of *length*, *width* and\n-   In some cases, it is possible to measure at any one of these locations, simple random sampling or stratified sampling can be used.\n-   There are many examples where it is not possible or convenient to do so, in which case some form of systematic sampling may be used.\n\n## Transects\n\n-   Spatial sampling often uses a systematic sampling scheme based on **transects**.\n\n-   A transect is a straight line along which samples are taken.\n\n-   The starting point, geographical orientation and number of samples are chosen as part of the sampling scheme.\n\n-   Samples will then be either taken at random points along the length of the line (*continuous sampling*) or systematically placed points (*systematic sampling*).\n\n## Transects\n\n-   Suppose we need to take samples of water quality on a lake.\n\n-   Our sampling scheme may use multiple transects simultaneously.\n\n![](figures/Transect.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"474\"}\n\n## Distance sampling {.smaller}\n\n::::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"40%\"}\n-   Is a popular method in ecology for estimating **animal abundance**.\n\n-   Data are obtained by measuring the **perpendicular distances** from a **transect** line to detected individuals.\n\n-   The probability of detection decreases with increasing distances via a *parametric function*.\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"60%\"}\n![](figures/distance-animation.gif){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"625\"}\n:::\n:::::\n\n## Quadrats\n\n-   In some cases, we will instead be interested in trying to understand the frequency of a certain species across space.\n-   A **quadrat** is a tool used in ecology and other settings for this purpose.\n-   A series of squares (quadrats) of a fixed size are placed in the habitat of interest, and the species within the quadrats are counted.\n-   The number of quadrats, and their positions and orientations are chosen as part of the sampling scheme.\n\n## Quadrats\n\nThe quadrats shown below were used to study orangutan nests in a region of Borneo.\n\n![](figures/Quadrat.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"474\"}\n\n## Grid Sampling\n\n-   It may often be useful to use a regular grid to make sampling convenient and efficient.\n-   The grid is overlaid on the spatial region, and a fixed number of samples (usually one) is taken from each grid square.\n-   We choose the size of the grid such that the number of squares relates to the number of samples we require.\n-   For example, for a region of size 5km $\\times$ 5km, choosing 1km $\\times$ 1km grid squares would give us 25 squares in total.\n\n## Types of Grid Sampling\n\n-   **Aligned Grid**: we take a sample from the *same* (randomly selected) coordinates within each square.\n-   **Centrally Aligned Grid**: we take a sample from the *central* coordinates of each square.\n-   **Unaligned Grid**: each grid square has a sample taken from *different* randomly selected coordinates.\n-   **Triangular Grid**: this is a modified version of the aligned grid where the points are fixed based on a triangular arrangement.\n\n## Types of Grid Sampling\n\n![](figures/Grids.jpg){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n## Summary of Grids\n\n-   The aligned and centrally aligned grids are convenient but may miss systematic patterns in the data.\n\n-   The unaligned grid avoids this, and combines the advantages of simple random sampling and stratified sampling. However, it can be inefficient for collection.\n\n-   The triangular grid can perform well in specific cases where the spatial correlation structures varies with direction.\n\n## Example: chlorophyll-*a* in Lake Balaton\n\n-   Aim: Estimate the average level of chlorophyll-*a* in Lake Balaton, Hungary.\n\n-   Levels are heavily affected by differences in the levels of nutrients along the length of the lake (known as a \"trophic gradient\").\n\n![](figures/BalatonSound.jpg){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n## Example: chlorophyll-*a* in Lake Balaton {.smaller}\n\n-   The **population** is all possible water samples from the lake, and our **sampling units** are individual water samples.\n-   Stratified random sampling seems appropriate here due to *heterogeneity* in the lake.\n-   We could design transects which cover most regions of the lake.\n\n::::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"40%\"}\n-   However, there may be difficulty accessing all areas by boat.\n-   Also potential issues with the boat itself disrupting the levels.\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"60%\"}\n![](figures/Balaton.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n:::\n:::::\n\n# Sample size\n\n## Sample size\n\n-   A crucial part of sampling is identifying the appropriate sample size for our study.\n-   If the sample is *too small*, it will not be sufficiently representative of the population.\n-   If the sample is *too big*, it will be expensive and time consuming to collect, which may defeat the purpose of using sampling in the first place.\n\n## Power and/or precision\n\n-   It is therefore important that we understand exactly what it is that we want from our sampling process.\n-   We can think about it in terms of two key aspects, **power** and **precision**.\n-   **Precision**: How accurately do I want (or need) to estimate the mean, median, variance etc?\n-   **Power**: How small a difference is it important to detect, and with what degree of certainty?\n\n## Using confidence intervals\n\n-   The general form of a 95% confidence interval for the population mean, $\\mu$ is\n\n$$\\bar{x} \\pm t_{1-\\alpha/2} \\sqrt{\\text{Var}(\\bar{x})}.$$\n\n-   The width of the interval is determined by the estimated standard error, $\\sqrt{\\text{Var}(\\bar{x})}$, and we know the formula for this contains $n$.\n\n-   Therefore, if we know how wide we need our interval to be (i.e. we know the required precision), we can calculate the $n$ required to do that.\n\n## Choosing the sample size\n\n-   Let our maximum required standard error be denoted as $U$.

The whole point of this exercise is to determine the size of our sample.\n-   So, what can we use instead?\n\n## Choosing the sample size {auto-animate =true}\n\n-   This calculation requires us to use $s^2$, the variance of our sample.\n-   But we don't have the sample yet. The whole point of this exercise is to determine the size of our sample.\n-   So, what can we use instead?\n-   Typically, we will use knowledge from prior studies where available, or will commission a small pilot study.\n\n## Example: PCB in salmon\n\n-   Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) is a carcinogenic pollutant often found in fish.\n-   We wish to estimate the mean PCB level in the salmon in a fish farm, and require a precision level (estimated standard error) of $\\pm 0.1 \\mbox{mg/kg}^2$.\n-   We know from previous studies that the variation of PCB in salmon flesh is $3.19^2$.\n-   How large a sample do we need?\n\n## Example: PCB in salmon\n\n-   We can solve our prior equation as\n\n$$n \\geq \\left(\\frac{s}{u} \\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{3.19}{0.1} \\right)^2 = 1018.$$\n\n-   We have estimated we need a minimum sample size of 1018 to obtain the required precision.\n-   In some cases this may be impractical, in which case we may have to settle for a lower precision.\n\n## Stratified sampling\n\nFor stratified sampling, this process is much more complicated.\n\n-   As well as considering the sample size, we also have to think about how to allocate our samples across the strata.\n-   A common approach is to specify a **cost mode**, where we take into account the different costs of sampling each stratum.\n-   The aim is to minimise the estimated standard error for a given total cost.\n\n## Cost model\n\n-   Let $C$ be the overall cost, let $c_0$ be the fixed overhead costs of the survey and let $c_l$ be the cost per sample in stratum $l$.\n-   Then our cost model is $$C = c_0 + \\sum_{l=1}^L c_l n_l.$$\n-   Typically $C$ is fixed, and the goal is to select the values of $n_l$ which allow us to obtain the best possible estimate.\n\n## Stratum sample sizes\n\n-   Now let $\\omega_l = N_l/N$ be the proportion of the overall population which is found within stratum $l$.\n\n-   Also let $\\sigma_l$ be the standard deviation for the population of stratum $l$.\n\n-   We can then compute the optimum number of samples in each stratum as\n\n$$n_l = n \\ \\frac{\\omega_l \\sigma_l /\\sqrt{c_l}}{\\sum_{k=1}^L \\omega_k \\sigma_k  /\\sqrt{c_k}}$$\n\n## Notes on stratum sample sizes\n\n-   If the costs are the same for all strata, the equation simplifies to what is known as the **Neyman allocation**\n\n$$n_l = n \\ \\frac{\\omega_l \\sigma_l}{\\sum_{k=1}^L \\omega_k \\sigma_k}$$\n\n-   We often calculate $n$ by a similar approach to that described for simple random sampling.\n-   In practice, the *population* standard deviation $\\sigma_l$ is often replaced by the *sample* standard deviation $s_l$.\n\n## Summary\n\n::: incremental\n-   We now know how to determine the correct sample size to use to obtain estimates with the desired precision.\n-   This requires some advance knowledge, e.g. the tolerable level of error, the cost of the experiment, and the expected standard deviation.\n-   However, bear in mind that we have not considered the possibility of missing data in our sample. Losing some data will impact precision.\n-   We've also assumed that all data points are independent. This is not always true for time series or spatial data. We will address this later in the\n:::\n\n# Monitoring Networks\n\n## Monitoring Networks {.smaller}\n\nA **monitoring network** is a set of stations placed across a region of interest to gather information about one or more environmental resource.\n\n::::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"40%\"}\n-   Aim to detect trends and unexpected changes.\n-   Standard sampling is adequate in many cases.\n-   However, the advantage of networks is that they can change over time.\n-   New sites can be added, different variables measured, technology improved.\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"60%\"}\n![](figures/EnvChangeNetwork.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"487\"}\n:::\n:::::\n\n## Example: Countryside Survey\n\n-   The Countryside Survey is a *census* of the natural resources of the UK's countryside.\n\n-   The first full survey was in 1978, and it was taken again at 6--10 year intervals until 2019.\n\n-   Since 2019, it has been funded as a \"rolling\" survey, measuring locations on 5-yearly cycles.\n\n-   The goal is to map changes at various different scales, as well as to understand what is driving those changes.\n\n## Example: Countryside Survey\n\n::::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"40%\"}\n-   **Stratified sampling** of 1km grid squares from across the UK.\n-   Strata chosen based on Institute of Terrestrial Ecology (ITE) land classification and broad habitat.\n-   <https://countrysidesurvey.org.uk/>\n-   How do we select the sites/resources to monitor?\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"60%\"}\n![](figures/SurveySquares.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"323\"}\n:::\n:::::\n\n## Generalised Randomised Tesselation Stratified (GRTS)\n\n**Generalised Randomised Tesselation Stratified**\n\nIs a form of spatially balanced probability sampling scheme\n\n-   Method for sampling an extensive environmental resource introduced by [@stevens2004]\n-   Builds on random, systematic and stratified sampling procedures while ensuring spatial balance.\n-   Used by USEPA and Marine Scotland to design monitoring networks\n\n## Generalised Randomised Tesselation Stratified (GRTS) {.smaller}\n\n:::::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"40%\"}\n1.

A square bounding box is superimposed onto the sampling frame and is divided into four equally sized square cells (level 1 cells).\n2.

The approach can be modified to allow for **unequal inclusion probabilities**.\n\n-   E.g., Suppose we would like larger lakes to be twice as likely to be selected as small lakes.\n\n-   Instead of given all lakes the same unit length we can give large lakes twice the unit length of small lakes.\n\n![](figures/lake_systematic_unequall.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n## Generalised Randomised Tesselation Stratified (GRTS)\n\nIn addition to unequal inclusion probabilities we can also perform stratified sampling.\n\n-   Instead of sampling from the entire sampling frame simultaneously, we divide a sampling frame into distinct sets of sites and select samples from each stratum independently\n\n-   The GRTS algorithm is applied to each strata to obtain stratum-specific samples.\n\n-   The R-package `spsurvey` implements GRTS algorithm to select spatially balanced samples via the `grts()` function.\n\n## Assessing Environmental Change\n\n-   The purpose of monitoring is to assess the changes in a particular variable over time.\n-   This can typically be carried out using standard statistical techniques, taking into account the structure of the data.\n-   Sometimes we are interested in whether a specific event has had an impact on the variable, e.g. the effect of new regulations on the air pollution level.\n-   Typically this involves assessing the levels before and after the event.\n\n## Before-After Designs\n\n-   It is generally very difficult to untangle the effects of a single event.\n\n-   Even if we identify a change in the mean or variance, how do we know that it is due to our event?\n\n-   Many environmental systems change naturally over time for any number of reasons.\n\n-   We don't have a statistical control. (We can't turn back the clock and check what would have happened without the event.)\n\n## Variable of interest\n\n-   However, this challenge is not unique to environmental data. (We face it regularly in statistics.)\n-   Often, we are only interested in the effect of one particular variable, but we have to account for other nuisance variables via regression or other techniques.\n-   We can also sometimes account for other unmeasured variability through random effects.\n-   The key is to acknowledge what you do and don't know, and to account properly for uncertainty.\n\n## Example: Before-After Single Site {.smaller}\n\n-   Assessing impact of intervention with data for one site. The site of interest is monitored before and after the time of the intervention.\n\n::::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"40%\"}\n**Statistical model**\n\n$$X_{ik} = \\mu + \\alpha_i + \\tau_{k(i)} + \\varepsilon_{ik}$$\n\n-   $\\mu$: overall mean\n-   $\\alpha_i$: effect of period (before/after)\n-   $\\tau_{k(i)}$: time within period\n-   $\\varepsilon_{ik}$: errors.\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"60%\"}\n![](figures/BASS.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n:::\n:::::\n\n## Example: Before-After Single Site {.smaller}\n\n-   Assessing impact of intervention with data for multiple sites.\n\n-   Select $j = 1,\\ldots,M$ sites in the impact area and sample before/after intervention.\n\n::::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"40%\"}\n**Statistical model**\n\n$$X_{ijk} = \\mu + \\alpha_i + \\tau_{jk(i)} + \\delta_j + \\varepsilon_{ijk}$$\n\n-   $\\mu$: overall mean\n-   $\\alpha_i$: effect of period (before/after)\n-   $\\tau_{jk(i)}$: time within period\n-   $\\delta_j$: site random effect\n-   $\\varepsilon_{ijk}$: errors.\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"60%\"}\n![](figures/BAMS.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n:::\n:::::\n\n-   Treating the sites as *subsamples* allows the sites to be used to improve estimation of the effect's magnitude.\n\n## Example: Before-After Control-Impact (BACI) {.smaller}\n\n-   One or more potentially impacted sites, and one or more non-impacted sites, are sampled before and after the time of the intervention.\n\n::::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"40%\"}\n**Statistical model**\n\n$$X_{ij} = \\mu + \\alpha_i + \\beta_j + (\\alpha\\beta)_{ij} + \\varepsilon_{ij}$$\n\n-   $\\mu$: overall mean\n-   $\\alpha_i$: effect of period (before/after)\n-   $\\beta_j$: effect of location (control/impact)\n-   $\\varepsilon_{ik}$: errors.\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"60%\"}\n![](figures/BACI.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n:::\n:::::\n\n# Summary points\n\n## Summary points {.smaller}\n\n-   We use information we obtain from a **sample** to make inference on the **population**.\n\n-   There are five steps to designing a sampling experiment:\n\n1.  Define the study objectives.\n2.  Summarise the environmental context.\n3.  Identify the target population.\n4.  Select an appropriate sampling design.\n5.  Implement and summarise.\n\n-   Types of sampling include:\n\n-   **Simple Random Sampling**\n\n-   **Stratified Sampling**\n\n-   **Systematic Sampling**\n\n-   **Spatial Sampling** (including Transects, Distance Sampling, Quadrats & Grid Sampling )\n\n## Summary points {.smaller}\n\n-   **Sample size** depends on the intended power and precision.\n\n-   E.g., if we want to estimate a mean value $\\bar{x}$, given a maximum required standard error $U$ and sample variance $s^2$, then sample size $n$ must be such that:\\\n    $$\n    \\sqrt{n} \\geq \\frac{\\sqrt{s^2}}{U}.\n    $$\n\n-   For stratified sampling, the optimum number of samples in each stratum $l$ is calculated as:\\\n    $$\n    n_l = n \\ \\frac{\\omega_l \\sigma_l /\\sqrt{c_l}}{\\sum_{k=1}^L \\omega_k \\sigma_k  /\\sqrt{c_k}}\n    $$\n\n-   A **monitoring network** is a set of stations placed in a region of interest to gather information about one or more environmental variables.\n\n-   Sampling methods such as GRTS can be used to identify the sites/resources to be monitored.\n\n##
