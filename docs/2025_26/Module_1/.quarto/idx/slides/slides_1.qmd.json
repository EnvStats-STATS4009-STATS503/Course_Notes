Are they representative of the population? How much uncertainty do we have?\n-   Are our models valid? Are the assumptions reasonable? Does the model make sensible predictions? How much uncertainty do we have in our results?\n-   These skills are particularly crucial in applied areas such as environmental and ecological statistics.\n\n## Example: Arctic Ice {.smaller}\n\n::::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"40%\"}\n![](figures/ArcticIceMap.png){width=\"341\"}\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"60%\"}\n-   Submarines have been used to measure Arctic sea ice.\n\n-   The ice has shrunk both in terms of thickness and extent. -\n\n-   We may soon see ice-free summers, which will have a devastating impact on sea life. -\n\n-   [Arctic sea ice article (clickable)](https://interactive.carbonbrief.org/when-will-the-arctic-see-its-first-ice-free-summer/)\n:::\n:::::\n\n## Example: Arctic Ice {.smaller}\n\n::::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"40%\"}\n![](figures/ArcticIceTimeSeries.png)\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"60%\"}\n-   Sometimes, quantification is required.\n-   February 2016 sea ice extent was the lowest in the satellite record at 14.22 million square kilometres (5.48 million square miles).\n-   The linear rate of decline for February is now 3.0 percent per decade.\n:::\n:::::\n\n## Understanding our data: trends\n\n-   Much of the statistical analysis of environmental and ecological data will focus on identifying **trends**.\n-   The statistical definition of a trend is a [long-term change in the mean level]{style=\"color:purple;\"}.\n-   Trends aren't restricted to being linear - we will also look at examples of non-linear trends.\n\n## Understanding our data: trends\n\n-   Trends generally tend to focus on the **mean** of the data.\n-   However, we may also be interested in observing other aspects of the statistical distribution.\n-   **Extreme value theory** looks specifically at the limits of our distribution, and focuses on rare (or extreme) events.\n\n# Policy, legislation and monitoring\n\n## Policy\n\n-   A great deal of environmental statistical research is funded by governments and regulatory bodies.\n-   They need to know where the biggest challenges lie so that they can allocate their resources appropriately.\n-   Evidence-based policy relies on measuring changes and also evaluating the impacts of existing policies.\n-   However, the environment will be one of many competing policy areas, and every government will prioritise it differently.\n\n## Policy {.smaller}\n\n::::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"40%\"}\n-   Policies made in context of multinational agreements.\n-   Held annually, COP is the United Nations Climate Change Conference.\n-   Aim to limit global temperature rise and achieve net zero emissions.\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"60%\"}\n![](figures/COP28.jpg){width=\"346\"}\n:::\n:::::\n\n-   Key achievement of 2024's COP29: wealthier countries to pay US\\$300 billion/year to less wealthy countries to finance climate change mitigation measures.\n-   [Report from UK's Climate Change Committee (clickable)](https://www.theccc.org.uk/publication/cop29-key-outcomes-and-next-steps-for-the-uk/)\n\n## Policy\n\n-   Environmental policy tends to use very specific language - *objectives, targets, guide values, standards, reductions relative to a baseline*\n\n-   Policy often prescribes monitoring quantities of interest over space and/or time.\n\n-   Quantities of interest will include *water, air and noise pollution, waste management, radioactive substances, biodiversity and animal and plant species*\n\n## Legislation\n\n-   Legislation is the legal framework used to implement policy.\n\n-   Most legislation focuses on setting targets or safe levels for the pollutants.\n\n-   A number of regulatory bodies exist specifically to monitor such things, e.g. [Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA, Scotland)](https://beta.sepa.scot/about-sepa/who-we-are/), [the Environment Agency (EA, England)](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/environment-agency/about) and [the European Environment Agency (EEA, EU)](%7Bhttps://www.eea.europa.eu/en).\n\n## Routine Monitoring\n\n-   Monitoring requirements may be prescribed in policy.\n-   Much of our data come from routine monitoring of our environmental quantities of interest.\n-   Government agencies often make these data available to researchers and/or the public.\n-   These data are used to assess compliance with legislation as well as to identify environmental trends and their potential impacts on society.\n-   We have already seen monitoring data in the air pollution and water quality examples.\n\n## Evidence from routine monitoring\n\n-   Assessment of long-term changes in **natural conditions**.\n\n-   Assessment of long-term changes resulting from **anthropogenic activities**.\n\n-   Ascertaining the **magnitude** and **impacts** of accidental pollution.\n\n-   Assessing compliance with the **standards** and **objectives** of protected areas.\n\n-   Quantifying **reference conditions**.\n\n## Policy, legislation and monitoring {auto-animate=\"true\"}\n\n::::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"30%\"}\n```{mermaid, echo=FALSE}\nflowchart TB\n  A(Policy) --> B(Legislation)\n  B --> C(Monitoring)\n  C --> D(Analysis)\n  D --> A\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"70%\"}\n-   Statistical analyses and reporting is important for ensuring compliance with legislation.\n-   Understanding trends, spatial and temporal patterns, and impacts is important for informing policy: \\textit{``evidence-based policy making''}.\n    -

In the UK this includes:\n-   National Environment Agencies,\n-   Government departments.\\\n-   Other parties/stakeholders:\n    -   Industrialists (extra cost), economists, special interest groups and organisations (Greenpeace, WWF etc.), the public.\n\n## Summary points\n\n-   **Environmental and Ecological statistics** is a broad term covering many different techniques.\n\n-   It can involve:\n\n    -   Decision-making\n    -   Prediction\n    -   Regulation\n    -   Understanding\n\n-   We need to communicate and present data and statistics to e.g. the public, government and subject-matter experts.\n\n## Summary points\n\n-   To understand quantities, we need to understand the process.\n-   We need to quantify the uncertainty and error, which have multiple sources:\n    -   Inherent variability of the process.\n    -   Imprecise knowledge of the process.\n-   We must collaborate with subject-matter experts, to ensure that we understand e.g. how the data were collected, are our model's predictions sensible?\n\n## Summary points\n\n-   We need to understand the policy and legislative context:\n    -   International agreements $\\rightarrow$ National-level policies $\\rightarrow$ Legislation.\n    -   Legislation is the legal framework used to implement policy.\n    -   Regulatory bodies monitor compliance with legislation through collecting routine monitoring data.\n-   Our work can inform policy decisions through ensuring that representative data are collected, and that results are appropriately interpreted and understood.\n\n## References\n\n-   Piegorsch, W.

Are they representative of the population? How much uncertainty do we have?\n-   Are our models valid? Are the assumptions reasonable? Does the model make sensible predictions? How much uncertainty do we have in our results?\n-   These skills are particularly crucial in applied areas such as environmental and ecological statistics.\n\n## Example: Arctic Ice {.smaller}\n\n::::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"40%\"}\n![](figures/ArcticIceMap.png){width=\"341\"}\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"60%\"}\n-   Submarines have been used to measure Arctic sea ice.\n\n-   The ice has shrunk both in terms of thickness and extent. -\n\n-   We may soon see ice-free summers, which will have a devastating impact on sea life. -\n\n-   [Arctic sea ice article (clickable)](https://interactive.carbonbrief.org/when-will-the-arctic-see-its-first-ice-free-summer/)\n:::\n:::::\n\n## Example: Arctic Ice {.smaller}\n\n::::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"40%\"}\n![](figures/ArcticIceTimeSeries.png)\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"60%\"}\n-   Sometimes, quantification is required.\n-   February 2016 sea ice extent was the lowest in the satellite record at 14.22 million square kilometres (5.48 million square miles).\n-   The linear rate of decline for February is now 3.0 percent per decade.\n:::\n:::::\n\n## Understanding our data: trends\n\n-   Much of the statistical analysis of environmental and ecological data will focus on identifying **trends**.\n-   The statistical definition of a trend is a [long-term change in the mean level]{style=\"color:purple;\"}.\n-   Trends aren't restricted to being linear - we will also look at examples of non-linear trends.\n\n## Understanding our data: trends\n\n-   Trends generally tend to focus on the **mean** of the data.\n-   However, we may also be interested in observing other aspects of the statistical distribution.\n-   **Extreme value theory** looks specifically at the limits of our distribution, and focuses on rare (or extreme) events.\n\n# Policy, legislation and monitoring\n\n## Policy\n\n-   A great deal of environmental statistical research is funded by governments and regulatory bodies.\n-   They need to know where the biggest challenges lie so that they can allocate their resources appropriately.\n-   Evidence-based policy relies on measuring changes and also evaluating the impacts of existing policies.\n-   However, the environment will be one of many competing policy areas, and every government will prioritise it differently.\n\n## Policy {.smaller}\n\n::::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"40%\"}\n-   Policies made in context of multinational agreements.\n-   Held annually, COP is the United Nations Climate Change Conference.\n-   Aim to limit global temperature rise and achieve net zero emissions.\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"60%\"}\n![](figures/COP28.jpg){width=\"346\"}\n:::\n:::::\n\n-   Key achievement of 2024's COP29: wealthier countries to pay US\\$300 billion/year to less wealthy countries to finance climate change mitigation measures.\n-   [Report from UK's Climate Change Committee (clickable)](https://www.theccc.org.uk/publication/cop29-key-outcomes-and-next-steps-for-the-uk/)\n\n## Policy\n\n-   Environmental policy tends to use very specific language - *objectives, targets, guide values, standards, reductions relative to a baseline*\n\n-   Policy often prescribes monitoring quantities of interest over space and/or time.\n\n-   Quantities of interest will include *water, air and noise pollution, waste management, radioactive substances, biodiversity and animal and plant species*\n\n## Legislation\n\n-   Legislation is the legal framework used to implement policy.\n\n-   Most legislation focuses on setting targets or safe levels for the pollutants.\n\n-   A number of regulatory bodies exist specifically to monitor such things, e.g. [Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA, Scotland)](https://beta.sepa.scot/about-sepa/who-we-are/), [the Environment Agency (EA, England)](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/environment-agency/about) and [the European Environment Agency (EEA, EU)](%7Bhttps://www.eea.europa.eu/en).\n\n## Routine Monitoring\n\n-   Monitoring requirements may be prescribed in policy.\n-   Much of our data come from routine monitoring of our environmental quantities of interest.\n-   Government agencies often make these data available to researchers and/or the public.\n-   These data are used to assess compliance with legislation as well as to identify environmental trends and their potential impacts on society.\n-   We have already seen monitoring data in the air pollution and water quality examples.\n\n## Evidence from routine monitoring\n\n-   Assessment of long-term changes in **natural conditions**.\n\n-   Assessment of long-term changes resulting from **anthropogenic activities**.\n\n-   Ascertaining the **magnitude** and **impacts** of accidental pollution.\n\n-   Assessing compliance with the **standards** and **objectives** of protected areas.\n\n-   Quantifying **reference conditions**.\n\n## Policy, legislation and monitoring {auto-animate=\"true\"}\n\n::::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"30%\"}\n```{mermaid, echo=FALSE}\nflowchart TB\n  A(Policy) --> B(Legislation)\n  B --> C(Monitoring)\n  C --> D(Analysis)\n  D --> A\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"70%\"}\n-   Statistical analyses and reporting is important for ensuring compliance with legislation.\n-   Understanding trends, spatial and temporal patterns, and impacts is important for informing policy: \\textit{``evidence-based policy making''}.\n    -

In the UK this includes:\n-   National Environment Agencies,\n-   Government departments.\\\n-   Other parties/stakeholders:\n    -   Industrialists (extra cost), economists, special interest groups and organisations (Greenpeace, WWF etc.), the public.\n\n## Summary points\n\n-   **Environmental and Ecological statistics** is a broad term covering many different techniques.\n\n-   It can involve:\n\n    -   Decision-making\n    -   Prediction\n    -   Regulation\n    -   Understanding\n\n-   We need to communicate and present data and statistics to e.g. the public, government and subject-matter experts.\n\n## Summary points\n\n-   To understand quantities, we need to understand the process.\n-   We need to quantify the uncertainty and error, which have multiple sources:\n    -   Inherent variability of the process.\n    -   Imprecise knowledge of the process.\n-   We must collaborate with subject-matter experts, to ensure that we understand e.g. how the data were collected, are our model's predictions sensible?\n\n## Summary points\n\n-   We need to understand the policy and legislative context:\n    -   International agreements $\\rightarrow$ National-level policies $\\rightarrow$ Legislation.\n    -   Legislation is the legal framework used to implement policy.\n    -   Regulatory bodies monitor compliance with legislation through collecting routine monitoring data.\n-   Our work can inform policy decisions through ensuring that representative data are collected, and that results are appropriately interpreted and understood.\n\n## References\n\n-   Piegorsch, W.
