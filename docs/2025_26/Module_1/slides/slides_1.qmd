## Welcome to Environmental and Ecological Statistics

-   **Environmental & Ecological Statistics** is an incredibly broad term covering any form of statistics applied to environmental issues.

-   Key themes include climate change, environmental regulation (eg water and air quality), biodiversity monitoring and ecosystem assessment.

-   This course focuses on this theme rather than a particular type of statistical methodology.

-   We will look at a variety of statistical methods, some of which you will know, and some which will be new.

## BBC article graphs task

-   Choose one of the graphs in the BBC article.

-   Think about what the good and bad aspects (if any) are.

-   Discuss with your neighbour(s) and find out what they thought about their chosen graph.

-   Add some of your thoughts to Mentimeter,

    -   E.g. What graph you chose.

    -   What is the graph's purpose?

    -   Does it do a good job at serving this purpose?

    -   What did you like/dislike about the graph?

## Where's the statistics?

::: incremental
-   Measuring, sampling or monitoring environmental and ecological data, including variation and uncertainty.

-   Ecosystem assessment, detecting and modelling trends, including trends in time and space.

-   Modelling and understanding extreme data.

-   Environmental regulation and policy, and risk assessment.
:::

## What are we looking for?

We want to understand changes in the environment and species respond to these changes, in either time, space or both.

::: incremental
-   Are things getting better or worse? Where, when and by how much?
-   What is going to happen next?
-   Where do authorities need to take action, and how can we check if existing actions are working?
-   Also consider complex relationships between environmental variables and species habitats.
:::

## Communicating and presenting data {.smaller}

-   Our skills in presenting and communicating data are also crucial.

-   We need to be able to explain our findings to the public and show them why our work is important.

## Examples

-   **Decision making:** Is it safe to eat fish from a particular river?
-   **Prediction:** What is the distribution of the Barn Swallow? Can we predict its distribution in 2030?
-   **Regulation:** Have emission control agreements reduced air pollutants?
-   **Understanding:** How did sea levels change over the past 100 years?

## Examples: Air pollution {.smaller auto-animate="true"}

Only **one person in ten** lives in a city that complies with the World Health Organisation Air quality guidelines.

![](figures/Shanghai.jpg){fig-align="center"}

## Examples: Air pollution {.smaller auto-animate="true"}

Only **one person in ten** lives in a city that complies with the World Health Organisation Air quality guidelines.

::: incremental
-   The World Health Organisation estimates that 1 in 9 deaths worldwide are due to pollution.
-   The total annual cost of air pollution to the UK economy could be as much as £54 billion.
-   Fine particular matter was associated with an estimated 2,000 premature deaths and 22,500 lost life years in Scotland in 2010.
-   The Cleaner Air for Scotland strategy seeks to reduce air pollution across Scotland.

## Water Quality

::::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
-   To inform government decision-making, we need to have appropriate data on water quality.
-   We need to sample water quality across lakes and rivers. How do we do this with the resources available?

-   Once we have the samples, how can we use the data to understand water quality patterns?

-   Statistical modelling approaches are required, often **spatial** and **temporal**.

-   We need to understand and report our **uncertainties**.
:::
:::::

## Quantification

-   Understanding and measuring quantities is a fundamental part of all science, not just statistics.
-   As scientists, we use data to understand the process which we are investigating.
-   These data have two main sources of uncertainty or error:
    -   **Inherent variability** of the process itself (the thing we are measuring is variable).
    -   **Imprecise knowledge** of the process (our measurements may not be accurate).

## Example: Climate change trends {background-color="#FFFFFF"}

-   These plots illustrate the trends in several climate change measures.
-   Both sources of variability will be present, but how much of each?

::: {layout-ncol="2"}
![](figures/TempAndSea.png){width="422"}

![](figures/GreenhouseCO2.png){width="541"}
:::

## Asking questions

-   A big part of our role as statisticians is to ask questions of both our data and our models.
-   How were our data collected? Are they representative of the population? How much uncertainty do we have?
-   Are our models valid? Are the assumptions reasonable? Does the model make sensible predictions? How much uncertainty do we have in our results?
-   These skills are particularly crucial in applied areas such as environmental and ecological statistics.

## Example: Arctic Ice {.smaller}

:::::: columns

:::: {.column width="60%"}
::: incremental
-   Submarines have been used to measure Arctic sea ice.

-   The ice has shrunk both in terms of thickness and extent.

-   We may soon see ice-free summers, which will have a devastating impact on sea life.

## Example: Arctic Ice {.smaller}

::::: columns

![](figures/ArcticIceTimeSeries.png)
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
-   Sometimes, quantification is required.
-   February 2016 sea ice extent was the lowest in the satellite record at 14.22 million square kilometres (5.48 million square miles).
-   The linear rate of decline for February is now 3.0 percent per decade.
:::
:::::

## Understanding our data: trends

-   Much of the statistical analysis of environmental and ecological data will focus on identifying **trends**.
-   The statistical definition of a trend is a [long-term change in the mean level]{style="color:purple;"}.
-   Trends aren't restricted to being linear - we will also look at examples of non-linear trends.

## Understanding our data: trends

-   Trends generally tend to focus on the **mean** of the data.
-   However, we may also be interested in observing other aspects of the statistical distribution.
-   **Extreme value theory** looks specifically at the limits of our distribution, and focuses on rare (or extreme) events.

# Policy, legislation and monitoring

## Policy

-   A great deal of environmental statistical research is funded by governments and regulatory bodies.
-   They need to know where the biggest challenges lie so that they can allocate their resources appropriately.
-   Evidence-based policy relies on measuring changes and also evaluating the impacts of existing policies.
-   However, the environment will be one of many competing policy areas, and every government will prioritise it differently.

## Policy {.smaller}

::::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   Policies made in context of multinational agreements.
-   Held annually, COP is the United Nations Climate Change Conference.
-   Aim to limit global temperature rise and achieve net zero emissions.

-   [Report from UK's Climate Change Committee (clickable)](https://www.theccc.org.uk/publication/cop29-key-outcomes-and-next-steps-for-the-uk/)

## Policy

-   Environmental policy tends to use very specific language - *objectives, targets, guide values, standards, reductions relative to a baseline*

-   Policy often prescribes monitoring quantities of interest over space and/or time.

-   Quantities of interest will include *water, air and noise pollution, waste management, radioactive substances, biodiversity and animal and plant species*

## Legislation

-   Legislation is the legal framework used to implement policy.

-   Most legislation focuses on setting targets or safe levels for the pollutants.

-   A number of regulatory bodies exist specifically to monitor such things, e.g. [Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA, Scotland)](https://beta.sepa.scot/about-sepa/who-we-are/), [the Environment Agency (EA, England)](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/environment-agency/about) and [the European Environment Agency (EEA, EU)](%7Bhttps://www.eea.europa.eu/en).

## Routine Monitoring

::: incremental
-   Monitoring requirements may be prescribed in policy.
-   Much of our data come from routine monitoring of our environmental quantities of interest.
-   Government agencies often make these data available to researchers and/or the public.
-   These data are used to assess compliance with legislation as well as to identify environmental trends and their potential impacts on society.
-   We have already seen monitoring data in the air pollution and water quality examples.
:::

## Evidence from routine monitoring

::: incremental
-   Assessment of long-term changes in **natural conditions**.

-   Assessment of long-term changes resulting from **anthropogenic activities**.

-   Ascertaining the **magnitude** and **impacts** of accidental pollution.

-   Assessing compliance with the **standards** and **objectives** of protected areas.

-   Quantifying **reference conditions**.

## The framework for environmental policy

-   Environmental policy is set at various levels:
    -   Internationally (Kyoto Convention, European Union)
    -   Nationally, by politicians
-   Environmental policy is implemented and monitored by regulators. In the UK this includes:
-   National Environment Agencies,
-   Government departments.\
-   Other parties/stakeholders:
    -   Industrialists (extra cost), economists, special interest groups and organisations (Greenpeace, WWF etc.), the public.

## Summary points

-   **Environmental and Ecological statistics** is a broad term covering many different techniques.

-   It can involve:

    -   Decision-making
    -   Prediction
    -   Regulation
    -   Understanding

-   We need to communicate and present data and statistics to e.g. the public, government and subject-matter experts.

## Summary points

-   To understand quantities, we need to understand the process.
-   We need to quantify the uncertainty and error, which have multiple sources:
    -   Inherent variability of the process.
    -   Imprecise knowledge of the process.
-   We must collaborate with subject-matter experts, to ensure that we understand e.g. how the data were collected, are our model's predictions sensible?

## Summary points

-   We need to understand the policy and legislative context:
    -   International agreements $\rightarrow$ National-level policies $\rightarrow$ Legislation.
    -   Legislation is the legal framework used to implement policy.
    -   Regulatory bodies monitor compliance with legislation through collecting routine monitoring data.
-   Our work can inform policy decisions through ensuring that representative data are collected, and that results are appropriately interpreted and understood.
