The *generalised* aspect means that we can also extend the standard additive model to situations where we have non-normal responses, but we will not focus on these in this course.\n\nWe use the function `gam()` to fit our model. This works in a very similar manner to the `lm()` function. The smooth functions are represented by `s()`. These use the penalised splines approach described last week. Any linear terms can be included additively as normal.\n\nThe model will take the form below, where you can include as many smooth or linear terms as you wish.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(mgcv)\n\nmod <- gam(response ~ s(smooth1) + s(smooth2) + linear)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.callout-important icon=\"false\"}\n## {{< bi box color=#005C8A >}} Example: River Tweed nitrate level\n\nThe nitrate levels in the River Tweed were measured monthly between 1997 and 2007.

(The p-value **doesn't** tell us whether the smooth term is different from a linear term!) \n\nThe effective degrees of freedom (EDF) tells us how nonlinear the relationship is:\n\n* Higher EDF means a more nonlinear relationship.\n* An EDF of 1 indicates a linear relationship.\n\nIn our example, the p-value is very small (<<0.05), and therefore we have evidence that this smooth term is necessary in our model.\n\nThe EDF for this term is 6.183, suggesting that this is far from linear and that a smooth term may be appropriate.\n\nWe can assess the significance of our smooth term using the `anova` function. We fit a simple linear regression and compare it to the additive model we have already fitted:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nm1 <- gam(log_nitrate ~ s(Date))\nm2 <- lm(log_nitrate ~ Date)\n\nanova(m2, m1)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n```         \nAnalysis of Variance Table\nModel 1: log_nitrate ~ Date\nModel 2: log_nitrate ~ s(Date)\n\n    Res.Df      RSS    Df    SS      F   Pr(>F)\n1     91.000   14.883\n2     85.817   12.549 5.183 2.334 3.0794 0.01228\n```\n\nThe p-value confirms that the smooth term is necessary instead of a linear term. (Note that we don't really need to test for nonlinearity, since the model should penalise excess wiggliness, effectively fitting a linear term where appropriate.)\n\n:::\n\n## Visualising additive models in R\n\nUnlike linear terms, we can't simply report parameter estimates for smooth terms in additive models. We can instead simply use the `plot` function to visualise our smooth functions.\n\n::: {.callout-important icon=\"false\"}\n## {{< bi box color=#005C8A >}} Example: River Tweed nitrate level (continued)\n\nHere, we observe that we may have a bimodal shape, with peaks in 1999 and 2005:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot(m1)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n![Plot of fitted smooth of time for River Tweed log(Nitrate) data. The black points are partial residuals, the black line is the estimated smooth, and the dashed lines are the 95% interval bounds for the estimated smooth.](images/TweedGAM.png){width=\"400\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nIn reality, we might spot that there is a seasonal pattern evident in the plot, which our smooth does not capture. We could capture this by either:\n\n* fitting a smooth to the months plus a smooth to years (to capture the seasonal pattern plus long term smooth trend), as we saw at the end of last week's notes, or\n* increasing the basis dimension for our smooth, using the `k` argument of the `s()` function. (See the help file of the `s` function in R for details, by running `?mgcv::s`.)\n\n:::\n\n# Autocorrelation\n\nWe already know that environmental data are often measured over time, and that consecutive measurements are often related. This relationship between adjacent observations is known as **autocorrelation**. The term *autocorrelation* literally means *correlation with oneself*. Here, we can think of it as each point being correlated with \"previous\" versions of itself.\n\nThe strength of autocorrelation tends to be related to how far apart points are in time (known as **lag**). Points closer together have more in common than those further apart.\n\nMany statistical models rely on an assumption that our observations (more specifically our error terms) are independent. If we have correlation then each observation \"shares\" some information with other observations. This means we have less independent information within our dataset and the *effective sample size* of the dataset will decrease. When we are calculate standard errors, confidence intervals etc., we are using the \"wrong\" value of $n$. This can lead to us underestimating the variance and being overconfident in our results.\n\n## Autocorrelation function\n\nWe can estimate the strength of temporal dependence using a sample **autocorrelation function (ACF)**. This function represents the autocorrelation of the data at a series of different lags in time. Assuming we have a regularly spaced time series, we compute the sample ACF at lag $k$ as:\n\n$$r(k) = \\frac{\\sum_{t=k+1}^n(x_t - \\bar{x})(x_{t-k} - \\bar{x})}{\\sum_{t=1}^n(x_t - \\bar{x})^2}$$\n\nWe compute this for values from $k=1,\\ldots,K$ where $K$ is some sensible maximum lag.\n\nOur sample ACF is an estimate of the overall ACF, and as such we have to consider uncertainty. Typically we will compute a simple confidence interval around our point estimate at each lag as\n\n$$r(k) \\pm 1.96\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n}}$$\n\nwhere $n$ is the number of observations in the time series.\n\nWe plot the ACF function with a separate vertical line representing the size correlation at each lag, and dashed lines for the confidence intervals. If the lines lie within the confidence intervals, no autocorrelation is present.\n\nHere, we have several lines outside the confidence intervals, so autocorrelation exists in this dataset.\n\n![](images/ACF2.png){width=\"300\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nEach of the three ACFs below are examples of cases where suggest autocorrelation is present.\n\n-   The first has a repeating pattern --- suggests seasonality:\n\n![](images/ACF1.png){width=\"300\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n-   The second has a decreasing pattern --- likely caused by trend:\n \n![](images/ACF2.png){width=\"300\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n \n-   The third has both patterns --- probably seasonality AND trend:\n\n![](images/ACF3.png){width=\"300\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nIf we have identified autocorrelation in our data, we have to find a way to account for it in our model. In some cases we may choose to simply treat it as a nuisance, and make adjustments to our standard errors to reflect the reduced effective sample size.\n\nThe alternative is to explicitly account for the autocorrelation in our model. For seasonal patterns, we may be able to eliminate it using methods discussed previously, such as harmonics. For other types of autocorrelation, we may use approaches such as autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA).\n\n## Autocorrelation models\n\n**Autoregressive integrated moving average** (ARIMA) models are a general class of models which account for autocorrelation. These models combine aspects of two main classes of model: autoregressive (AR) and moving average (MA).\n\nBroadly speaking, AR($p$) models assume that the current value is a function of the previous $p$ observations. In contrast, MA($q$) models assume that the current value can be computed by a linear regression on the $q$ previous random error terms. These models are covered in more detail in the Time Series course, but will be addressed briefly here.\n\n### AR model\n\nAn autoregressive (AR) model accounts for correlation by describing each value as a function of the previous values. The AR($p$) process can be written as\n\n$$X_t = \\sum_{i=1}^p \\phi_i X_{t-i} + \\epsilon_t.$$\n\nHere $\\phi_i$ is the \"autoregressive parameter\" which measures the strength of the autocorrelation. $\\epsilon_t \\sim \\mbox{N}(0, \\sigma^2)$ is simply random error, often referred to as noise.\n\n### MA model\n\nA moving average (MA) model accounts for correlation by describing each value as a function of the previous set of error terms. The MA($q$) process can be written as\n\n$$X_t = \\mu + \\sum_{i=1}^q \\theta_i \\epsilon_{t-i} + \\epsilon_t.$$\n\nHere $\\mu$ is the mean of the series and $\\theta_i$ is the regression parameter associated with the $i$th lag.\n\n### ARIMA\n\nThe ARIMA is a combination of AR and MA processes. The I stands for *Integrated*, which relates to \"differencing\", i.e., replacing a value with the difference between itself and the previous value. We write this model as ARIMA($p,d,q$), where $p$ is the order of the AR process, $d$ is the degree of differencing and $q$ is the order of the MA.\n\nFor example, ARIMA(1,0,0) would be equivalent to an AR(1) model and ARIMA(0,0,1) is an MA(1) model.\n\nWe can use the sample ACF to suggest the appropriate model to account for our autocorrelation. A smooth decay suggests that we have AR components. A less structured ACF might suggest an MA is more appropriate. In practice, AR processes are less complex than MA and tend to be used more frequently as a result.\n\n::: {.callout-important icon=\"false\"}\n## {{< bi box color=#005C8A >}} Examples of ACF plots\n\n![](images/ACF4.png){width=\"500\"} ![](images/ACF5.png){width=\"250\"}\n\nPlot A has a clear seasonal pattern, meaning that harmonics may be more appropriate than an ARIMA.\n\nIn Plot B, the value at lag 1 is outside the interval, and thus an AR(1) may be most suitable. (Note that we can likely ignore the spike at lag 12 as just random error).\n\nPlot C does not appear to have any correlations outside of the error bars, and so we can conclude that there is no evidence of autocorrelation. Note that the bars are wider. This is likely because we had less data available.\n\n:::\n\nARIMA methods are all based on regularly spaced data (measurements equally spaced in time). However, in some cases we may have irregularly spaced data. If the data are roughly regular (just a small deviation here and there), we may be able to treat them as though they are regular. If we have missing data, we may be able to impute or interpolate without too many issues. In cases where we have completely irregular data, we may need to use more complex statistical methods (which will not be covered in this course).\n\n### ARIMA in R\n\nWe can use the `arima()` function in R to explore autocorrelation. We must first fit a linear model, and then extract the design matrix to use as an input to this function. For example, to fit an AR(1) model we would use the following code:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntrend.model0 <- lm(response ~ decimal.date)\n\nX <- model.matrix(trend.model0)\n\ntrend.model1 <- arima(y, order = c(1, 0, 0), xreg = X, \n                      include.mean = FALSE)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Changepoints\n\nOne of the main reasons we analyze environmental data is to detect changes. Sometimes these changes occur organically, either as the result of some natural environmental process, or some non-deliberate human action. In some other occasions these changes occur by design, as the result of a deliberate and controlled human action (e.g., policy changes). Regardless of the reason for the change, we want to understand more about when it happened and the extent of the change.\n\nIn statistics, a **changepoint** is a point in time after which some or all of the model parameters might change. Most commonly this is a change in mean or variance, but it could also be a change in some other feature of the data. We may not always know exactly when the changepoint occurs or whether we have a changepoint at all. In some cases we may have more than one changepoint.\n\nReasons for changepoints might include:\n\n-   Environmental events, e.g. flooding, volcanic eruption.\n-   Policy, e.g. low emissions zones, water quality regulations.\n-   Changes to measuring equipment.\n\n![Plot showing shifts in mean values at changepoints. X-axis is time, y-axis is value, red lines represent the 4 mean levels, and black lines join the data points.](images/Changepoints.png){width=\"400\" fig-align=\"center\"} \n\n![Plot showing shifts in variance at changepoints. X-axis is time, y-axis is value, and black lines join the data points.](images/Changepoints2.jpeg){width=\"400\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nSome simple examples of changepoints include:\n\n-   A shift up (or down) of the mean.\n-   A short-term change in the mean.\n-   A change in a model parameter, eg slope.\n\n![Illustration of the simple examples of changepoints above.](images/ChangepointTypes.png){width=\"300\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nConsider a series with two different mean levels. The first 20 observations come from $\\mbox{N}(10,1)$ and the next 20 observations come from $\\mbox{N}(15,1)$. Our ability to detect this change depends on the size of the change and the variability in the data. The plots below illustrate these data and a possible model for these.\n\n![Plot of response value by time point, for the 20 observations from $\\mbox{N}(10,1)$ followed by the 20 observations from $\\mbox{N}(15,1)$. Data are red points.](images/MeanChangeData.png){width=\"300\"} ![Illustration of a possible model for the data in the previous plot, with times $t$ and response values $Y$, with changepoint $c$.](images/MeanChangeModel.png){width=\"300\"}\n\nIt can be difficult to distinguish changepoints from trend. The plots below illustrate how the magnitude of the shift in mean value can affect our ability to identify the shift in mean. The bottom right plot illustrates the additional effect of a change in variance.\n\n![Plots of data (response value by time point) from different distributions with mean shifts at timepoint 20.](images/MeanShiftExamples.png){width=\"500\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n## Known changepoint\n\nSometimes it is known that a change occurred at a specific timepoint, but the magnitude or shape of this change are not known.\n\n### Known changepoint --- mean shift\n\nSuppose that we have a series of data $Y_i$ collected at a set of timepoints $t_i$ with $i=1,\\ldots, n$. If our known changepoint is at time $c$, then we can construct an indicator function $$\\mathcal{I}_{t_i} = \n\\begin{cases}\n0\\hspace{0.5cm} \\text{if } \\hspace{0.1cm} t_i < c\\\\\n1\\hspace{0.5cm} \\text{if } \\hspace{0.1cm} t_i \\geq c\n\\end{cases}$$ This can then be included as a parameter in our regression model $$Y_i = \\beta_0 + \\varphi\\mathcal{I}_{t_i} + \\epsilon_i$$\n\nHere, $\\varphi$, the coefficient of the indicator function ,can be described as the **intervention effect**. If this parameter is significant in our model, that implies that we have a significant change in mean at timepoint $c$.\n\n### Known changepoint --- change in slope\n\nWe also need to consider examples where we observe a change in slope at a known timepoint.\n\n![Plot of value by time, with data as black dots, and changepoint at time $c$ illustrated by vertical dashed red line.](images/SegmentData.jpg){width=\"300\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nIt would be possible to fit two separate regressions. However, this seems quite simplistic, and it would be better to have a single continuous model.\n\n![Plot of value by time, with data as black dots, and changepoint at time $c$ illustrated by vertical dashed red line. Blue regression lines represent the fitted separate regression models.](images/SegmentNaive.jpg){width=\"300\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nWe want our regression to be continuous at $c$ such that we have $$\\alpha_1 + \\beta_1 c =  \\alpha_2 + \\beta_2 c$$ This can be rewritten in terms of a single model parameter, as $$\\alpha_2 = \\alpha_1 + c(\\beta_1 - \\beta_2)$$ We can thus update our equations to the following, which is known as **piecewise regression** (or segmented regression):\n\n\\begin{align*}\nY_i &= \\alpha_1 + \\beta_1 x_i + \\epsilon_i\\hspace{16mm} &\\mbox{ for } x<c\\\\\nY_i &= \\alpha_1 +  (\\beta_1 - \\beta_2)c + \\beta_2 x_i + \\epsilon_i\\hspace{2mm} &\\mbox{ for } x\\geq c\n\\end{align*}\n\n(Note that this could be expressed as a single model using our indicator function.)\n\nThe two linear parts of our model now meet at $c$. Note that our piecewise model is more efficient than two separate regressions, since it uses one fewer parameter.\n\n![Plot of value by time, with data as black dots, and changepoint at time $c$ illustrated by vertical dashed red line. Grey regression lines represent the fitted piecewise regression model.](images/SegmentModel.jpg){width=\"300\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nIn many cases, we may have more complex changes to our trend. There are a variety of more advanced models for known changepoints, but these are all based on the same underlying principles. For example, the bent cable model allows for an extended \"transition phase\" between the two slopes, often represented by a smooth curve.\n\n::: {.callout-important icon=\"false\"}\n## {{< bi box color=#005C8A >}} Example: Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)\n\nChlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are pollutants which were often used in aerosols. Their use was phased out in the 1990s as a result of environmental policy. We can see this \"phasing out\" period represented in the model.\n\n![Diagram illustrating the bent cable model as fitted to CFC-11 (ppt) values between 1988 and 2000.](images/CFC.png){width=\"500\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n\n## Unknown changepoint\n\nIt can be more challenging to fit a changepoint model when you don't clearly know exactly when the change occurred. One of the most popular methods is an iterative approach which searches across the entire range of our data for possible changepoints.\n\n::: {.callout-important icon=\"false\"}\n## {{< bi box color=#005C8A >}} Example: River Nile flow data\n\nWe have historic data on the levels of the River Nile around the city of Aswan, Egypt. Is there any evidence of a change in water volume? If so, when did it occur?\n\n![River Nile.](images/Nile.jpg){width=\"200\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n![Plot of River Nile volume by year, Aswan.](images/NileData.png){width=\"350\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nWe can examine the data by fitting a LOWESS curve. There does appear to be a change around 1900. However, we need to explore this further via a model.\n\n![Fitted LOWESS curve for River Nile data.](images/NileLoess.png){width=\"350\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nWe use the `segmented()` function in R (in the package also called `segmented`) to fit an unknown changepoint model, using the following steps:\n\n* First, fit a standard regression using `lm()`.\n* We then pass the linear model into our `segmented()` function along with an initial estimate of the changepoint.\n* This initial estimate (`psi = 1900`) is used as a starting point for our iterative algorithm.\n\nWe run this in R:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nout.lm <- lm(Volume ~ Year)\nmod <- segmented(out.lm, seg.Z = ~Year, psi = 1900)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n```         \npsi1.x  \n  1913  \n  \nslope(mod)\n$x\n          Est. St.Err. t value\nslope1 -8.1820   1.759  -4.650\nslope2  0.7458   1.084   0.688\n```\n\nThe final model output suggests that the changepoint occurred in 1913. Prior to 1913, the volume was decreasing by 8.18 units per year. Afterwards, it was increasing by 0.75 units per year.\n\nThe Aswan Low Dam was constructed between 1899--1902, massively impacting river levels in the area. Therefore it is more sensible to fit a model which introduces a mean shift, rather than a change of slope. Subject matter expertise is key!\n\n![Aswan Dam.](images/Aswan.png){height=\"180\"} ![Aswan Dam from above.](images/Aswan2.png){height=\"180\"}\n\nIn this case, given there is a clear reason why the time series will change either side of the dam's construction, we need to fit two separate models. The plot below shows two separate penalised spline models for the before and after periods.\n\n![Fitted LOWESS curves for River Nile data (separate for before/after 1900).](images/NileShift.png){width=\"350\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n",
